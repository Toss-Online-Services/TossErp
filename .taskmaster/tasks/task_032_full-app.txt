# Task ID: 32
# Title: Monorepo cleanup: remove stale root Node artifacts; align to clients/web
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Audit root and src-level Node artifacts (package.json, lockfiles) and remove or migrate to src/clients/web. Ensure web client is the only Node workspace unless additional clients exist.
# Details:
- Identify stray package.json files at repo root or src/ that are not part of clients.
- Remove or archive deprecated Node projects; update docs accordingly.
- Ensure src/clients/web has complete setup (postcss, tailwind, eslint, tsconfig) and runs.
- Add a root-level .nvmrc (Node 20) and optional Volta config for consistency.
Acceptance: npm scripts run only under src/clients/web; docs updated; CI uses correct path.

# Test Strategy:
Run npm ci && npm run dev from src/clients/web; verify no root-level npm scripts are required.
