# Task ID: 31
# Title: Scaffold remaining domain services (HR, Projects, Logistics, PooledCredit, CreditEngine, AssetSharing)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27, 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Create .NET service skeletons following Stock/Sales layout (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API). Add Program.cs with RFC9457 ProblemDetails, Serilog, OpenTelemetry, Health checks, Swagger; Dockerfile; appsettings; baseline csproj wiring to ServiceDefaults and Contracts. Prepare initial EF Core migrations and docker-compose entries.
# Details:
Deliverables:
- Folders: src/Services/{hr,projects,logistics,pooledcredit,creditengine,assetsharing}/ with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API projects
- API: Minimal endpoints (/health, /_status) and Swagger; ProblemDetails per RFC9457; Serilog request logging; OpenTelemetry tracing/metrics
- Infrastructure: DbContext + initial migration stubs; connection string via env; RLS template hooks
- Docker: Multistage build, non-root run, healthcheck
- Compose: Add each service with ports and dependencies (postgres, rabbitmq)
- Solution: Add projects to TossErp.sln under Services folder
Acceptance:
- dotnet build succeeds for all new projects
- docker build works per service
- GET /health returns 200
- Basic OpenAPI served at /swagger

# Test Strategy:
Build and smoke test each service: dotnet build; dotnet run; curl /health; verify Swagger UI loads.
