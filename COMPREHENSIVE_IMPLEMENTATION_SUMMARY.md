## üéì LESSONS LEARNED & PATTERNS

### Successful Patterns
1. **Entity Pattern:** BaseEntity with audit fields
2. **Domain Events:** DomainEvent base class with EventId and OccurredOn
3. **Repository Pattern:** Interfaces in Domain, implementations in Infrastructure
4. **Configuration Pattern:** One config class per entity
5. **Controller Pattern:** Thin controllers, business logic in domain
6. **DTO Pattern:** Request/Response records
7. **Validation Pattern:** FluentValidation ready
8. **Soft Delete Pattern:** Global query filter
9. **Async Pattern:** Async/await throughout

### Established Conventions
- Entity IDs are integers (auto-incrementing)
- Money stored as integers (cents) - R1.00 = 100
- All amounts use `decimal` type with Precision(18,2)
- Enums stored as strings in database
- Collections stored as JSON where appropriate
- Timestamps in UTC
- Audit fields: CreatedBy, UpdatedBy, DeletedBy + timestamps
- Navigation properties always initialized to empty collection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Technical Debt
1. **Test Runtime:** .NET 9/10 SDK version conflict (structure correct, runtime issue)
2. **PDF Generation:** Using HTML bytes, needs actual PDF library (PuppeteerSharp/iText7)
3. **Email Service:** Placeholder implementation, needs SMTP integration
4. **Charts:** Placeholders in dashboards, need Chart.js integration
5. **SignalR:** Not yet implemented for real-time dashboard updates
6. **Rate Limiting:** Not implemented (recommended for production)
7. **API Versioning:** v1 implicit, needs explicit versioning
8. **Elasticsearch:** Not integrated (optional for advanced search)

### Functional Gaps (Foundation Exists)
1. **API Controllers:** Modules 8-17 need full controller implementation
2. **Web Dashboards:** 11 additional dashboards needed
3. **Mobile Data Sources:** Local (SQLite) implementations needed
4. **Offline Sync:** Full sync mechanism pending
5. **AI Integration:** Copilot features pending
6. **Report Builder:** Advanced reporting UI pending
