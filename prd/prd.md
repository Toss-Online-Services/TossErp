TOSS ERP III – Product RequirementsDocument
===========================================

Introduction
------------

TOSS ERP III is a comprehensive enterprise resource planning platformthat integrates traditional business management modules with innovative **cooperativeeconomy** features and an AI-driven **Business Co-Pilot**. It is designedto support both **product-based businesses** (e.g. retail, distribution,light manufacturing) and **service-based businesses** (e.g. agencies,contractors, consultancies) with a modular, scalable solution. The system’svision is to streamline all core operations of an organization – from finance andsales to inventory and projects – while also enabling multiple businesses to **collaborate**for mutual benefit through co-op style features. By incorporating cooperativemechanics (like group purchasing and resource sharing) and an AI assistant,TOSS ERP III aims to reduce costs, improve decision-making, and increaseproductivity across the board.

**Product Goals and Vision:** TOSS ERP III seeksto empower small and medium enterprises to operate more efficiently and **cooperatively**.Core goals include:

·      **Unified Operations:** Provide a single platform where businesses can manage finances, supplychain, sales, human resources, and projects in an integrated way. The ERPensures data flows seamlessly between modules (e.g. sales orders flowing intoinvoicing and inventory updates), minimizing duplicate work and errors.

·      **Cooperative Economy Enablement:** Introduce features that allow businesses to leverage **collectivestrength** – for example, pooling purchasing power, sharing tools and assets,and pooling credit resources – thereby achieving cost savings and capabilitiesthat would be out of reach individually. (For instance, **group purchasing**helps members obtain bulk pricing and lower costs, similar to how cooperativebuying groups enable small businesses to get competitive prices that rivallarger enterprises[\[1\]](https://ncbaclusa.coop/resources/co-op-sectors/purchasing-co-ops/#:~:text=Individual stores who are members,quality and the group’s leadership).)

·      **Intelligent Assistance andAutomation:** Leverage artificial intelligence (theBusiness Co-Pilot) to automate routine tasks, provide data-driven insights, andoffer a natural language interface (chat or voice) for interacting with thesystem. This AI assistant helps users work smarter by answering questions,generating reports or content, and even executing multi-step workflows oncommand. It acts as a productivity **copilot**, enabling fasterdecision-making and reducing manual busywork[\[2\]](https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html#:~:text=What is Joule?).

·      **Flexibility for DifferentBusiness Types:** Ensure the feature set is flexibleenough to support various industries. Product-focused companies can utilizemodules like Inventory, Procurement, and Logistics, while service-orientedcompanies can make use of Project Management and Time Tracking – all within thesame platform. Common features (e.g. Finance, CRM, HR) are applicable to both,and any module can be enabled or disabled based on the business’s needs.

·      **Scalability and Integration:** TOSS ERP III is a cloud-first solution with a modern technicalarchitecture. It supports **API integrations** for connecting withe-commerce sites, payment gateways, or other specialized systems. Thearchitecture is modular and extensible, allowing additional Phase II and IIImodules (like the AI assistant and co-op features) to plug in seamlessly.Strong security (role-based access control, data encryption) and multi-tenantcapabilities are included, especially as cooperative features may involve **cross-organizationdata sharing** with proper permissions.

Core Functional Modules (Phase I)
---------------------------------

TOSS ERP III’s core modules cover the end-to-end workflows needed torun a business. These modules are available in the current system (Phase I) andprovide a foundation for all users. Each module is designed with an intuitiveUI, configurable workflows, and reporting capabilities.

### Financial Management (CoreModule)

This modulehandles all accounting and financial tasks to keep the business’s books inorder. It supports both accrual and cash accounting and is compliant withstandard accounting principles. Key features include:

·      **General Ledger (GL):** Chart of accounts, journal entries, and automatic posting of entriesfrom sub-ledgers. Users can generate financial statements (balance sheet,income statement, cash flow) and close periods. Multi-currency support isbuilt-in for companies dealing with foreign currencies.

·      **Accounts Payable (AP) andAccounts Receivable (AR):** Manage bills, vendorinvoices, and payments (AP) as well as customer invoicing, receipts, and agingof receivables (AR). The system tracks due dates, helps schedule payments, andcan automate payment reminders or late fee calculations.

·      **Billing and Invoicing:** Create professional invoices or bills from orders or projects.Recurring invoice support is available for subscription or retainer services(useful for service businesses). The system can handle sales taxes (VAT/GST),discounts, and multiple payment terms (e.g. net 30, installment plans).

·      **Expense Management &Banking:** Record expenses and purchases, attachreceipts, and manage petty cash or employee reimbursements. Bank reconciliationfeatures allow linking with bank feeds to automatically match transactions.

·      **Budgeting and Reporting:** Set budgets for departments or projects and track performance versusbudget. Financial reports and dashboards give real-time visibility into cashflow, profitability, and key ratios. Users can drill down from summaryfinancials to transaction details.

TheFinancial Management module ensures that both **product and service businesses**can maintain healthy finances. For example, a product company can track Cost ofGoods Sold and inventory value, while a service firm can track project-relatedexpenses and billable revenues. Robust reporting helps in compliance (taxfilings, audits) and strategic planning.

### Sales & CustomerManagement (Core Module)

Thismodule combines sales order processing with basic Customer RelationshipManagement (CRM) functionality to handle the revenue side of the business. Ithelps track leads through deals, and once sales are made, it manages orderfulfillment and customer invoicing. Key capabilities:

·      **Leads and Opportunities:** Track potential customers (leads) and sales opportunities. Sales teamscan log communications, schedule follow-ups, and update the status of deals ina simple CRM interface. This helps service businesses manage client pipelinesand product businesses manage wholesale/B2B prospects.

·      **Quotations and Sales Orders:** Generate quotes or estimates for customers with predefined products orservices and pricing. Once approved, quotes can be converted to sales orders.Sales orders trigger downstream processes (e.g., reserve stock, scheduleservice delivery).

·      **Order Fulfillment:** For **product sales**, the system supports picking, packing, andshipping processes. It integrates with Inventory and Logistics modules toensure orders are fulfilled accurately and on time. For **service sales**,orders can be tied to project tasks or service tickets to ensure the service isdelivered to the client.

·      **Invoicing and RevenueRecognition:** Convert orders into invoicesautomatically. Support various billing scenarios – one-time shipments,milestone billing for projects, or recurring subscriptions. The module can alsohandle credit notes/refunds and adjustments if needed. Invoices flow into theFinancial module for revenue tracking.

·      **Customer Data & CRM:** Maintain a database of customers with contact details, purchasehistory, and communication logs. The system can log customer interactions(emails, calls) and store documents (contracts, proposals). This 360° view isuseful for account management and marketing. Basic CRM analytics (like salespipeline reports, conversion rates, top customers) are available.

Byconsolidating sales and customer management, TOSS ERP III ensures a smoothjourney from initial customer inquiry to final sale and after-sales support.Both sales-driven service firms and product sellers benefit from timelyfollow-ups, organized sales processes, and responsive customer service (withall information in one place).

### Inventory &Procurement Management (Core Module)

Thismodule is critical for product-oriented businesses (and useful for any companythat manages physical assets or supplies). It tracks inventory levels in realtime, supports purchasing of goods, and manages supplier relationships. Keyfeatures include:

·      **Inventory Control:** Maintain records of all products, materials, or assets with SKU codes,descriptions, categories, and units of measure. The system tracks stock levelsby location (multiple warehouses or stores), and supports inventoryadjustments, transfers between locations, and cycle counts/audits. It can alertusers when stock is low or about to expire (for perishable goods).

·      **Procurement & PurchaseOrders:** Create **purchase requisitions** and **purchaseorders (POs)** for suppliers. The module streamlines the purchasing workflow:request, approve, order, receive, and invoice matching. Users can managesupplier info, price lists, and terms. When goods are received, inventory isupdated and the PO is marked as fulfilled (integrating with Financials foraccounts payable).

·      **Warehouse Management:** Organize warehouse operations with support for bins/slots, pickinglists, and goods receipt notes. The system can optimize picking routes andbatch orders together for efficiency. For more advanced needs, support forbarcode scanning and serialization is available (Phase II could extend this).

·      **Product Attributes &Costing:** Track product attributes like lot numbers orserial numbers if needed, and maintain cost records (standard cost, movingaverage, or FIFO/LIFO costing methods). The module calculates inventoryvaluation for the balance sheet automatically based on transactions.

·      **Vendor Management:** Keep a directory of vendors/suppliers with contact details and trackperformance (on-time delivery, quality). The system can record supplier ratingsand history of purchases. This ties into cooperative features like group buying(detailed later), where multiple companies might collectively engage withvendors.

Inventory& Procurement ensure that a product business never loses a sale due tostock-outs and never ties up excess capital in overstock. Even servicebusinesses can use a simplified version of this module to manage supplies orcompany assets (for example, an IT service company tracking its loanerequipment or spare parts). The module’s **integration** with Sales (fordemand signals) and Finance (for costing and payables) provides end-to-endvisibility of the supply chain.

### Project & ServiceManagement (Core Module)

Forservice-centric organizations or any business running internal projects, thismodule provides tools to plan, execute, and monitor projects and jobs. It helpsensure services are delivered efficiently and projects stay on budget. Majorfeatures:

·      **Project Planning:** Create projects with start/end dates, milestones, and deliverables.Tasks can be defined with dependencies, and assigned to team members. Thesystem can allocate resources (staff, equipment) to tasks and identifypotential scheduling conflicts or overbooking.

·      **Time Tracking & Timesheets:** Team members can log hours worked on tasks or projects. This iscritical for professional services (consulting, agencies) that bill clientsbased on time, and also useful for internal cost tracking. Timesheet approvalsworkflow is available for managers.

·      **Project Budgeting &Costing:** Set project budgets for labor, expenses, andmaterials. As time and expenses are logged, the system shows budget vs actualin real time. It can capture all project-related costs (travel, purchases) andtie them back to the project record.

·      **Service Delivery Management:** If the business offers field services or tickets, the module canhandle scheduling service appointments, tracking service requests, and ensuringfulfillment of service contracts. This can integrate with CRM (customer supportcases) and even the Inventory module if spare parts are used in service jobs.

·      **Billing & RevenueRecognition for Projects:** The module links withFinancials to support project billing – whether it’s time-and-materialinvoices, fixed-price project milestones, or recurring service fees. It ensuresno billable work falls through the cracks by pulling approved timesheet hoursand expenses into invoices.

Project& Service Management brings discipline to service delivery and projectexecution. A marketing agency, for example, can manage multiple clientcampaigns as separate projects with assigned teams and due dates. Aconstruction firm can plan out phases of a build and track costs. By havingthis in the ERP, the project data is connected to financial outcomes (somanagement can see profitability per project) and resource utilization (to spotwho is over or under-worked).

### Human Resources &Payroll (Core Module)

Thismodule covers basic HR needs and payroll processing for employees. It ensuresthat employee information is organized and that staff are paid accurately andon time. Key capabilities include:

·      **Employee Records:** Maintain a database of employees with personal info, job titles,departments, and documents (IDs, contracts). Track employment history,promotions, and performance notes. Role-based permissions ensure HR data issecure and only accessible to authorized users.

·      **Time Off and Attendance:** Allow employees to request leave (vacation, sick days) through thesystem. Managers can approve requests, and the system tracks balances ofavailable leave. An attendance tracker can log working days or shifts, whichcan integrate with project timesheets if needed.

·      **Payroll Processing:** Define payroll elements like salary, hourly wages, overtime, bonuses,and deductions. The module can compute payroll for each period, handling taxesand withholdings as configured for the locale. It generates payslips foremployees and summary reports for finance. Payroll transactions post to theFinancial module (for expenses and liabilities).

·      **Compliance and Benefits:** Store information on benefits (health insurance, retirement plans) andmanage enrollments. The system can also assist in compliance reporting such asworkforce statistics or tax filings related to payroll.

·      **Self-Service Portal:** (If applicable) Employees might have a self-service view where theycan see their payslips, submit time sheets or leave requests, and updatepersonal details. This reduces administrative overhead on HR staff.

Byintegrating HR into TOSS ERP III, companies ensure that their **peopleoperations** align with other business processes. For example, projectcosting can include actual payroll costs, and sales commissions (if any) can bepaid out through payroll. Though this module covers general HR needs, it isdesigned to be **generic** and flexible so it can handle both salaried staff(more common in service firms) and hourly or shift workers (often inretail/manufacturing settings).

### Reporting & Analytics(Core Module)

Across allmodules, TOSS ERP III provides robust reporting and analytics tools. Users cangenerate standard reports or create custom reports to analyze the data capturedby the ERP. Key aspects of this cross-cutting module:

·      **Dashboards:** Interactive dashboards show KPIs and summary metrics for differentroles – for example, a CEO dashboard might show sales, expenses, and cashbalance; a sales manager sees pipeline and top deals; an operations managersees inventory turns and fulfillment status. Dashboards can combine data frommultiple modules (thanks to a unified data model).

·      **Report Builder:** A flexible report writer allows users to slice and dice data. They cancreate reports (tabular or charts) using any fields from the database (subjectto permissions). Common reports are available out-of-the-box: sales by product,expenses by category, employee hours by project, etc. Users can schedulereports to run and be emailed periodically.

·      **Analytics & Forecasting:** Basic analytical tools are integrated, such as trend analysis orforecasting based on historical data. For example, forecasting cash flow basedon open invoices and bills, or predicting inventory stock-out dates based oncurrent sales velocity. These help businesses anticipate issues.

·      **Exports and Integration:** All report data can be exported to formats like Excel or PDF forfurther analysis or presentations. Additionally, the system’s API allowsexternal BI tools to connect if more advanced analytics are needed.

·      **Audit Trails:** Every module logs key changes (who edited a record, when, and whatchanged). This provides accountability and traceability, which is especiallyimportant for financial data and multi-user collaboration.

Thereporting module ensures decision-makers have **real-time insights** intotheir operations. By consolidating data across functions, it breaks down silos– you can correlate sales with inventory levels, or project hours with payrollcosts, all in one place. This lays the groundwork for even more advancedAI-driven insights provided by the Business Co-Pilot in Phase III.

Cooperative Economy Features
----------------------------

One of the standout innovations of TOSS ERP III is its built-in supportfor **cooperative economy** features. These allow independent businessesusing the ERP (for example, members of a business network or co-op) to worktogether and leverage their collective power. The following features (availablein Phase II and beyond) are designed in both product and technical terms tofacilitate multi-organization collaboration securely within the ERPenvironment.

**Overview:** The cooperative features areoptional and can be enabled for groups of businesses that trust each other(such as a formal cooperative, franchise network, or any consortium). Whenenabled, the ERP creates a **shared space** or marketplace where members canparticipate in group activities (buying, sharing, lending) while keeping theirindividual company data partitioned. Role-based permissions and smartcontracts/agreements underpin these features to ensure fairness and transparencyamong participants. Below are the key co-op economy features:

### Group Buying &Collective Procurement

GroupBuying allows multiple businesses to **pool their purchases** to achievebulk discounts and better terms from suppliers. In practice, the ERP provides acooperative purchasing portal where users can propose purchase needs thatothers can join. Key elements of this feature:

·      **Joint Purchase Requests:** A member can initiate a purchase request for a certain product or rawmaterial, indicating quantity and target price. Other members of the co-opnetwork are notified and can commit to a portion of the order (e.g. Business Aneeds 100 units, Business B adds 200 units). The system aggregates thesecommitments into a single **group purchase order**.

·      **Vendor Negotiation andContracts:** Suppliers see a combined order from theco-op, which increases order size and **purchasing power**. By buying as agroup, members can negotiate **more favorable pricing** and volume discountsthat they wouldn’t get individually[\[3\]](https://www.clarity-ventures.com/buying-group-ecommerce-overview#:~:text=,intelligently adapt to each user). TheERP can integrate with vendor systems or send out RFQs (requests for quotation)to get the best offer for the group. Once a deal is secured, the systemfinalizes the group PO.

·      **Allocation and Drop-Shipping:** The group PO is then split into individual orders for eachparticipating business according to their committed quantities. The systemhandles split shipping instructions – for example, instructing the supplier todeliver specified portions to each member’s address (the **split shipping**capability is integrated). Each business receives their share, but all benefitfrom the bulk pricing.

·      **Settlement and Accounting:** Financially, the ERP can either have each member pay the vendordirectly for their part, or use a central fund (if the co-op has one) to payand then invoice each member. The system records the transaction in eachmember’s Financial module appropriately. It also logs the savings achievedthrough group buying (e.g. percentage discount vs regular price) fortransparency.

·      **Governance and Permissions:** Only authorized proposals are visible to the network. Businesses canset criteria on which group buys they join (for instance, only from vettedsuppliers or for certain categories of items). The system enforces these rules.

_Benefit:_ Group buying empowers small businesses to act together as a largebuyer. **Cooperative purchasing helps members reduce costs and offercompetitive prices** compared to larger rivals[\[1\]](https://ncbaclusa.coop/resources/co-op-sectors/purchasing-co-ops/#:~:text=Individual stores who are members,quality and the group’s leadership). In thesystem, this translates to improved profit margins on goods and the ability tocompete with big players on pricing. Technically, implementing this requiredmulti-company data sharing and order-splitting logic, which TOSS ERP IIIhandles with a robust cross-org workflow engine.

### Shared Asset & ToolSharing Network

Thisfeature enables businesses to share expensive tools, equipment, or otherresources with each other – effectively creating a **tool library** orrental network within the co-op. The ERP provides a catalog of shareable assetsand a reservation system to coordinate usage. Key aspects:

·      **Shared Asset Registry:** Companies can list assets they own that they are willing to lend orshare, such as machinery, vehicles, meeting facilities, or specialized tools.Each asset entry can include availability schedule, usage terms (e.g. any feesor deposit required), and conditions (like needing certified operators). Theregistry is visible to members of the network, creating a pooled asset base.

·      **Reservation & BookingSystem:** If a member company needs an asset (say apiece of equipment they don’t own) they can put in a reservation request for itthrough the system. The ERP handles scheduling – checking availability andavoiding double-booking. It allows the owner to approve the request if neededand coordinates pickup/delivery logistics. The **integrated booking system**lets participants make reservations, check real-time availability, and getnotifications for their bookings[\[4\]](https://www.weeshare.com/en/blog/cooperatives-and-sharing-portals-two-powerful-partners#:~:text=It is clear that now,used to its full capacity).

·      **Cost Sharing & Tracking:** The system keeps track of any costs associated with using the sharedasset – for example, maintenance, fuel, or wear-and-tear fees. It can recordwhich party covered what expense and automatically split or reimburse costsaccording to agreed formulas. All participants can see **who paid what andwhen**, ensuring transparency in cost distribution[\[5\]](https://www.weeshare.com/en/blog/cooperatives-and-sharing-portals-two-powerful-partners#:~:text=Furthermore, costs can be assigned,to a variable mileage package). Ifthere’s a rental fee, the ERP can handle invoicing between the parties (or to acentral co-op account).

·      **Asset Care and Accountability:** To build trust, the module can record condition reports or requirechecklists when handing over an asset. If damage occurs, there’s a process forreporting and assigning responsibility. A rating or feedback system can be inplace so members maintain mutual accountability.

·      **Technical Implementation:** Under the hood, this uses a multi-tenant calendar and asset managementsystem. Each asset is owned by one entity but visible in the sharedmarketplace. Permissions ensure only authorized members can book. Notifications(emails or in-app) keep everyone updated on reservations or cancellations.

_Benefit:_ Shared asset usage means each business doesn’t have to individuallyinvest in rarely-used expensive tools – they **save money by sharing resources**.For example, instead of five companies each buying a machine that sits idlemost of the time, one can buy it and rent/share with the others. This embodiesthe “sharing economy” in a B2B context. As one case study notes, a sharingplatform allows users to **manage their shared items, coordinate reservationrequests, and keep track of costs and expenses** all in one place[\[6\]](https://www.weeshare.com/en/blog/cooperatives-and-sharing-portals-two-powerful-partners#:~:text=WeeShare is the tool that,expenses at the same time). TOSS ERPIII’s implementation focuses on the act of sharing rather than profit, so anycost savings or rental earnings go directly to the participants, not to amiddleman platform. This fosters trust and true cooperation among the userbase.

### Pooled Credit & MutualFinancing

Pooled Creditis a cooperative financial mechanism where businesses band together to improveaccess to credit and financing. In TOSS ERP III, this feature is facilitated bythe **Credit Engine** (detailed in the next section) and allows members toeither borrow from a common fund or collectively guarantee loans for eachother. Key components:

·      **Co-op Credit Pool Management:** Member businesses can contribute funds into a shared credit pool(almost like a credit union or mutual fund within the network). The ERP keepstrack of each member’s contributions (equity stakes) and available pool size.The pool can then be used to issue loans or lines of credit to members in needof financing. This structure mirrors how **credit unions** operate: memberspurchase shares and **the money is pooled together and used to providefinancial services to the members**[\[7\]](https://utahscreditunions.org/news/the-cooperative-structure-of-a-credit-union/#:~:text=Credit unions are financial organizations,financial services to the members).

·      **Loan Requests and ApprovalWorkflow:** A member can apply for a loan or credit linefrom the pool via the system. The application captures purpose, amount, andproposed repayment terms. The ERP’s Credit Engine evaluates the request byanalyzing the applicant’s financial data (e.g. revenue trends, payment history,credit score if available) and possibly the overall health of the pool. Thesystem can either auto-approve based on rules or route the request to acommittee of member representatives for approval (capturing the cooperativegovernance aspect).

·      **Collective Guarantee and CreditScoring:** In cases where external financing is involved(like the co-op collectively approaching a bank), the system can produce aconsolidated credit profile combining the strength of multiple businesses.Essentially, members can **co-guarantee** each other’s loans – the ERPtracks these guarantees as contingent liabilities. The Credit Engine mightgenerate a **mutual credit score** for the group that is higher than anindividual score, unlocking better interest rates or credit limits due todiversified risk.

·      **Repayment and Profit Sharing:** If a loan is issued from the co-op pool, the borrowing member willrepay it to the pool with interest. The ERP handles scheduling repayments,deducting from the borrower’s account, and returning funds to the pool. Anyinterest earned can be distributed to the contributing members as a dividend orused to grow the pool, according to rules configured. All transactions arerecorded in each member’s books appropriately (e.g. interest expense forborrower, interest income for lenders).

·      **Risk Monitoring:** The Credit Engine continuously monitors members’ financial health andcan flag risks (for example, if a member’s sales are plummeting and they havean outstanding co-op loan). It can alert the co-op if intervention is needed(perhaps adjusting payment plans). The system ensures that the cooperativespirit of “mutual assistance” is maintained – members are literally **cooperatingwith one another to help each other be financially successful**, sharing bothrisks and rewards in the credit program[\[8\]](https://utahscreditunions.org/news/the-cooperative-structure-of-a-credit-union/#:~:text=Image: Diagram of credit union,and bank structures).

_Benefit:_ Pooled credit gives businesses access to financing that mightotherwise be unattainable or expensive. By sharing risk and acting as a mutualsupport system, members improve their financial stability. For example, a smallbusiness that could only get a high-interest loan alone might secure a lowerrate when the co-op collectively guarantees it. In TOSS ERP III, this featurealso fosters financial transparency and discipline, as members know their datamight be considered in co-op credit decisions (encouraging good financialpractices). The technical challenge of this feature is ensuring **secure datasharing and isolation** – each company’s financial data is private, butsummary metrics used for credit scoring can be shared in aggregate. We employdata anonymization and aggregation techniques in the Credit Engine to protectsensitive information while enabling trust among members.

Advanced Modules & Features (Phase II & III)
--------------------------------------------

In addition to the core and cooperative features, TOSS ERP IIIintroduces advanced modules in Phase II and Phase III of its roadmap. Thesemodules further extend the system’s capabilities into specialized areas such aslogistics and AI-driven assistance. Below is an overview of these advancedcomponents, all of which integrate seamlessly with the core modules describedearlier.

### Logistics &Supply Chain Management (Planned Phase II)

TheLogistics module builds on Inventory Management and focuses on the **distributionand delivery** side of the business. It is particularly valuable forproduct-centric businesses or any organization that needs to move goodsefficiently. Key features planned include:

·      **Shipping & CarrierIntegration:** Generate shipments from sales orders ortransfer orders, and manage the packing and shipping process. The system canintegrate with major shipping carriers (UPS, FedEx, DHL, local couriers) toprint labels, schedule pickups, and track shipments via tracking numbers.Real-time shipping rates can be fetched to choose the most cost-effectivedelivery method for each order.

·      **Route Planning & DeliveryManagement:** For companies with their own deliveryfleets or multiple delivery stops, the module can optimize delivery routes andschedules. It uses parameters like truck capacities, locations, and deliverytime windows to minimize fuel cost and delivery times. Drivers can have amobile app integration for delivery confirmations (signatures, photos).

·      **Advanced Warehousing:** Extend basic warehouse management with features like wave picking(grouping orders for batched picking runs), cross-docking (direct transfer fromreceiving to shipping to fulfill backorders faster), and perhaps automationintegration (support for conveyer or robotics systems with API hooks).

·      **Logistics Analytics:** Track key metrics such as on-time delivery rate, shipping cost perorder, and inventory turnover. The system can identify bottlenecks (e.g.frequent delays with a certain carrier or at a certain warehouse) and suggestimprovements. It also provides visibility into the supply chain – from suppliershipments coming in (inbound logistics) to customer orders going out(outbound).

·      **Collaboration & EDI:** For companies that work closely with supply chain partners, the modulesupports Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards to send/receive order andshipping information. This is useful in cooperative logistics too – forexample, if co-op members decide to **share warehousing or transport**. Onemember’s warehouse could serve as a regional hub for others, and the systemwould handle multi-company inventory ownership within a shared location. (Thisconcept can complement the co-op features, though it requires strict controlsin the software to attribute stock to the right owner).

Byintroducing Logistics management, TOSS ERP III will enable businesses to **deliverproducts faster and more cost-effectively**. It reduces manual work inarranging shipments and provides end-to-end traceability from warehouse tocustomer. This module is slated for Phase II and will be designed to meet theneeds of growing businesses that require more sophisticated supply chain toolsthan the basic inventory module offers. It also naturally ties into the groupbuying cooperative feature – for instance, if multiple businesses do a groupbuy, the logistics module can coordinate distributing that bulk order to eachparticipant efficiently.

### Credit Engine &Financing Hub (Planned Phase II)

TheCredit Engine is an advanced module that underpins the **financial analyticsand financing** capabilities of TOSS ERP III. While core Financial Managementhandles bookkeeping, the Credit Engine goes a step further into **creditanalysis, risk management, and financing options** for the business and itscustomers. This module is central to enabling things like the pooled creditco-op feature, but it also serves standalone purposes for individual companies.Key functions include:

·      **Customer Credit Management:** If a business sells to customers on credit (e.g. offering net paymentterms or installment plans), the Credit Engine helps manage that. It cancompute credit scores or ratings for each customer by analyzing their paymenthistory, order volumes, and external credit data if available. Based onconfigurable policies, it will recommend credit limits for each customer andflag risky accounts. This reduces bad debt by guiding sales to make informeddecisions on extending credit.

·      **Dynamic Credit Decisions:** The module can integrate with sales orders to provide real-time checks– for example, warning if a new order will put a customer over their creditlimit or if a customer has overdue invoices. It can automate holds on ordersfor non-payment or release them when payment comes in. These rules ensurehealthy cash flow while maintaining customer relationships.

·      **Financing & Loans:** Beyond managing receivables, the Credit Engine allows the businessitself to seek financing. It can package the company’s financial data (withpermission) to present to potential lenders or investors. The idea is to have a**Financing Hub** where a business owner can see various funding options(bank loans, invoice factoring, credit lines, etc.) possibly offered throughintegrated financial partners. The ERP could integrate with fintech APIs to,say, get a loan quote based on current receivables or to automatically sell aninvoice to a factor for immediate cash.

·      **Credit Analysis & RiskForecasting:** Using machine learning, the module canforecast cash flow and detect financial risks. For instance, it might analyzepatterns to predict that “based on current burn rate and receivables, thecompany will face a cash shortfall in 3 months” and then suggest actions (likecutting certain costs or drawing from a credit line). It can also score theoverall financial health of the business and track metrics like debt-to-equity,interest coverage, etc., over time.

·      **Integration with Co-op** Pooled Credit\*\*\*\*: As described earlier, the Credit Engine powers thepooled credit feature by analyzing multiple members’ data in aggregate. Itensures that decisions in the co-op credit program are data-driven and fair.Technically, it isolates individual data and only uses anonymized metrics forgroup scoring unless explicit consent is given for deeper sharing. It can alsointerface with external credit bureaus or community development financialinstitutions if the co-op seeks outside capital to augment the pool.

Overall,the Credit Engine & Financing Hub is about giving businesses **financialintelligence and options** at their fingertips. Many small businessesstruggle with credit management and financing – this module is like having asmart financial advisor built into the ERP. It will help a business decide whomto trust with credit sales, when to borrow money, and how to optimize theirfinancial strategy. This is slated for Phase II and will heavily utilize dataanalytics and possibly AI models (for credit scoring), making it a naturalprecursor to the full AI Co-Pilot in Phase III.

### AI BusinessCo-Pilot & Voice Assistant (Planned Phase III)

TheBusiness Co-Pilot is a transformative feature of TOSS ERP III, bringing thepower of AI and natural language interaction to the platform. It acts as anintelligent assistant that is omnipresent across the ERP, ready to help userswith questions, analyses, and even perform tasks through simple prompts. TheCo-Pilot can be interacted with via a chat interface or through voice commands,making the ERP far more accessible and proactive. Key characteristics andcapabilities:

·      **Conversational Interface (Chat& Voice):** Users can interact with the ERP bysimply talking or typing in natural language. For example, a user could ask, “_Whatwere our top 5 selling products last month?_” or say, “_Show me the cashflow trend for this quarter_.” The Co-Pilot will understand the request,retrieve the relevant data from the system, and present an answer (in text, andvisually with charts if appropriate). It uses a combination of natural languageprocessing and the system’s data context to interpret what the user needs. _Voice-driveninteraction_ is a key focus – **users can speak directly to the Co-Pilot,asking questions or issuing commands without typing**, enabling hands-freeoperation for busy managers[\[9\]](https://windowsforum.com/threads/microsoft-copilot-vision-the-future-of-ai-powered-windows-assistance.370433/?amp=1#:~:text=A standout aspect of Copilot,Microsoft pushes the envelope by).The assistant can execute multi-step voice commands as well (for example, “_findall overdue invoices and send reminders_” and it will carry out thoseactions).

·      **AI-Powered Insights:** The Co-Pilot doesn’t just fetch data – it provides insights. It canproactively analyze data to highlight trends or anomalies. For instance, itmight alert a user, “_Noticing that Q2 sales are 15% lower than Q1 – here aresome factors (like product X decline or region Y slowdown)._” It leveragesgenerative AI and machine learning models on top of the company’s data to drawconclusions. This is similar in spirit to SAP’s **Joule AI copilot**, whichis _grounded in business data and uses AI agents to proactively assistemployees across applications while automating complex processes_[\[2\]](https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html#:~:text=What is Joule?).In TOSS ERP III, the Co-Pilot can surface opportunities (e.g. a product that’sselling fast and needs restock), assess risks (e.g. a project likely to missits deadline based on current pace), and even suggest actions (likerecommending a group buy for an item several co-op members need).

·      **Task Automation with AI Agents:** The Co-Pilot is not only for Q&A; it can take action on behalf ofthe user. Backed by AI “agents” under the hood, it can perform multi-stepworkflows when instructed. For example, a user could say, “_Create a purchaseorder for 50 units of item ABC from our cheapest supplier and set delivery bynext Friday_.” The Co-Pilot will confirm the details and, upon approval,execute those steps: lookup item ABC’s preferred supplier and price, create thePO in the system, and forward it for approval or send to the supplier asconfigured. It essentially serves as a semi-autonomous assistant that cannavigate across modules (sales, inventory, finance) to complete an objective.These **AI agents** are able to reason and use the ERP’s functions like apower user, which means many routine tasks can be offloaded to them.

·      **Learning and Context Awareness:** The Business Co-Pilot learns from user interactions. It adapts to eachuser’s role and preferences – for instance, if a sales manager always asksabout a certain report on Mondays, it might start showing that proactively. Itis context-aware, meaning if you’re looking at a particular customer’s screen,you can ask “_what is the total revenue from this customer?_” and it knowsyou mean the one currently displayed. It can also chain context, so you coulddrill down further by saying “_show me their last 5 orders_” after thefirst question, in a conversational flow.

·      **Safety, Security & Control:** From a technical perspective, the AI Co-Pilot is integrated with theERP’s permission system. It will only access data the current user is allowedto see. All AI-generated actions (like creating a transaction) go through theusual validation and approval flows. The system keeps logs of what the AI didor recommended for audit purposes. Administrators can configure the level ofautonomy (for example, allowing the Co-Pilot to draft an email to a client butnot send it without human review, or to create a purchase order but mark it forapproval). The AI models are “grounded” in the company’s actual data to preventhallucinations – essentially, the Co-Pilot cross-checks its answers with thedatabase, ensuring **accurate, context-rich responses based on business data**[\[10\]](https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html#:~:text=Joule is SAP’s AI copilot,,make business users more productive).

_UseCases:_ The Business Co-Pilot brings many practicalbenefits. New or infrequent users of the ERP can simply ask for what they needinstead of navigating menus, which lowers the learning curve. Seasoned userscan save time – imagine a CEO getting a quick spoken briefing: “_Give me asummary of this week’s performance_,” and the Co-Pilot reads out a shortreport (sales, key payments, any alerts). It can also help enforce bestpractices: e.g. if inventory is running low and the user asks for status, theCo-Pilot might not only report “20 units left” but also follow up with “_Wouldyou like me to create a restock order?_”. In essence, it shifts the ERP froma passive tool to a proactive advisor and collaborator. This aligns with theindustry trend of AI assistants in business software, where **copilots providea human-like conversational experience and a broad range of capabilities tohelp users complete tasks more efficiently**[**\[11\]**](https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html#:~:text=What is an AI copilot?).

PhaseIII will see the full rollout of this Co-Pilot and Voice Assistant. It willleverage state-of-the-art AI (likely a combination of large language models,custom-trained on ERP terminology, and predictive analytics models for businessdata). We also anticipate continuous improvement – the Co-Pilot will gainskills over time, possibly via an **AI Skill Store or Studio** where newcapabilities (for specific domains or custom company needs) can be added. Thisensures the AI evolves with the business, always staying relevant and valuable.

Conclusionand Next Steps
------------------------

TOSS ERP III represents a next-generation ERP system that not onlycovers the **breadth** of business operations (from finance to HR, inventoryto sales) but also delves into **innovative depth** with its cooperativeeconomy features and AI integrations. By including both current modules andplanned Phase II/III modules, this PRD outlines a full vision of the product: aplatform where businesses manage their own operations and also **collaborate**with a community, aided by intelligent automation.

In summary, the **key benefits** of TOSS ERP III are:

·      **Operational Efficiency:** A unified system reduces friction between departments and processes.Automation (both traditional workflow and AI-driven) cuts down manual effortand errors, allowing staff to focus on high-value tasks.

·      **Cooperative Empowerment:** Features like group buying, shared resources, and pooled credit givesmaller businesses the advantages of scale and solidarity, fostering a spiritof “win-win” collaboration. Members of a network can achieve together what theycan’t alone – whether it’s buying at bulk prices or accessing credit on betterterms – thereby strengthening the entire community[\[12\]](https://ncbaclusa.coop/resources/co-op-sectors/purchasing-co-ops/#:~:text=As part of a purchasing,efficiencies and increased market power)[\[7\]](https://utahscreditunions.org/news/the-cooperative-structure-of-a-credit-union/#:~:text=Credit unions are financial organizations,financial services to the members).

·      **Informed Decision-Making:** Through rich analytics and the Business Co-Pilot, users gain **real-timeinsights and advice**. Decisions are backed by data and AI recommendations,reducing guesswork. The system can highlight trends or issues early (thanks topredictive analytics) so that businesses can be proactive rather than reactive.

·      **Adaptability:** The modular design means TOSS ERP III can be tailored to eachbusiness. A company can start with core modules and then **unlock**additional modules (Logistics, Credit Engine, etc.) as their needs evolve.Similarly, cooperative features are opt-in – they can be introduced as trustand demand grows among a user group. This flexibility makes the productsuitable for a wide range of industries and scales.

·      **User-Friendly Experience:** With the Co-Pilot’s conversational UI and overall emphasis onusability (short, guided processes, alerts and notifications for importantevents, a modern web interface, and mobile access), the ERP is approachableeven to non-experts. Training time is reduced, and user satisfaction isincreased when the system feels like a partner in daily work, not a hindrance.

Going forward, the development of TOSS ERP III will prioritize securityand reliability, especially as more advanced features (AI andmulti-organization functions) come into play. Each phase will undergo thoroughtesting with pilot users – for instance, the Co-Pilot will be beta-tested witha small group to refine its responses and ensure it meets real businessscenarios accurately. User feedback loops will guide refinements (e.g. addingnew co-op features that early adopters suggest, or adjusting AI behavior tobetter fit user expectations).

By combining robust enterprise functionality with cutting-edgecollaboration and AI, TOSS ERP III is poised to become a **business co-pilot**in the truest sense – handling the heavy lifting of operations, enablingcooperative strategies, and guiding users to success. This PRD will continue tobe refined as we move through Phase II and Phase III, incorporating detailedspecifications for each module and incorporating feedback from stakeholders.The end vision, however, remains clear: **an ERP platform that not onlymanages businesses, but also helps them grow** _**together**_**, smarter andfaster**.
