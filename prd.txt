Perfect. I'll update the PRD to include basic AI-assisted features—such as inventory recommendations, sales forecasting, chatbot support, and business insights—embedded directly in user workflows. The collaboration module will also include system-driven peer-to-peer supply chain support, resource pooling, and group purchasing, using data to intelligently match businesses.

I'll get started and let you know when the updated PRD is ready.


# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – TOSS Platform MVP

## 1. Executive Summary

The Township Open Support System (TOSS) is a **next-generation ERP III platform** designed for informal micro and small enterprises in South Africa's township and rural economies. Backed by the Township and Rural Entrepreneurship Programme (TREP), TOSS aims to **digitally empower businesses such as spaza shops, tailors, bakers, mechanics, and street vendors** that traditionally operate offline. These enterprises often lack access to formal tools and bulk-buying power – for example, only *1%* of informal retailers accept electronic payments and most lack wholesale purchasing relationships. As a result, margins are thin and operations inefficient.

TOSS addresses these challenges by providing a **comprehensive yet user-friendly ERP solution** accessible via mobile devices and web. The MVP will cover **core ERP features** – accounting, inventory management, sales/point-of-sale, and basic CRM – tailored to the needs of micro-businesses. Going beyond a traditional ERP, TOSS embraces the *ERP III* paradigm by **connecting businesses to each other and leveraging AI-driven insights** for decision support. This means the platform not only manages internal operations but also **facilitates collaboration across a network of small businesses (a "borderless enterprise") and provides predictive intelligence** to its users. Key differentiators of TOSS include:

* **Mobile-First, Offline-Capable Access:** Designed for smartphones as the primary interface, with offline-first functionality to work reliably in areas with intermittent internet. A web dashboard is also available for broader screens.
* **Integrated AI Tools:** Built-in AI assistants and analytics that offer inventory restock recommendations, sales forecasts, and real-time business health alerts. A chatbot is embedded to guide users and answer support questions in simple language.
* **Collaboration Module:** Unique features that enable peer-to-peer supply chain matching, group purchasing, and resource pooling among local businesses, helping even the smallest shop gain the benefits of scale and collective power.

Overall, the TOSS MVP will enable township entrepreneurs to **streamline operations, increase sales, and collaborate with peers** like never before. By digitizing stock management and purchasing, TOSS can help reduce costs (e.g. via bulk buying) and improve revenues – early programs have shown that such digitization leads to higher operational efficiency and sales growth for spaza owners. This PRD outlines the detailed requirements, design, and roadmap for delivering this MVP to our product, engineering, and executive stakeholders.

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics

The primary goals of the TOSS platform align with improving **Collaboration**, **Sales**, and **Operational Efficiency** for township and rural businesses. Success will be measured through quantifiable metrics in each category:

* **Enhanced Collaboration:** We aim to foster a networked community of micro-enterprises. Key metrics include **participation in group activities** (e.g. number of group purchase orders created per month, or percentage of users engaged in at least one collaboration feature) and **supply network connections** established (e.g. how many peer supplier matches or resource-sharing arrangements are made via the platform). Ultimately, success is an increase in collective bargaining power and reduced input costs for users (e.g. securing bulk discounts on stock). For example, if a cooperative order of stock is placed through TOSS, we might track the cost savings achieved versus buying individually.

* **Increased Sales & Revenue:** TOSS should help businesses grow their sales by improving stock availability and customer management. Metrics will include **sales volume growth** (month-over-month increase in revenue recorded through the app) and **customer base growth** (number of unique customers or transactions). We will also monitor **order fulfillment rates** (reduction in stockouts) and the adoption of digital sales (e.g. how many sales are done via digital payment vs cash over time). Success is defined by trends such as higher monthly turnover per business and more consistent sales patterns. (For instance, by using TOSS inventory alerts and forecasts, a shopkeeper can avoid running out of popular items, thereby capturing more sales.)

* **Operational Efficiencies:** The platform should streamline day-to-day management, saving time and reducing errors. We will track **efficiency metrics** like time to record a sale (target: <10 seconds on mobile), **inventory turnaround** (faster stock replenishment cycles), and **financial accuracy** (e.g. fewer cash leakages, reconciled accounts). Qualitative measures include user feedback on ease of use and reduced administrative burden. The goal is that entrepreneurs spend more time selling and less time on paperwork. We expect to see improvements like fewer stockouts, lower idle inventory, and better cash flow control due to timely insights. For example, by having digital stock management and bulk purchasing through TOSS, spaza owners can gain greater control over purchases and reduce transport costs.

We will consider the MVP successful if, within the pilot group, we observe a significant uptake of collaborative features (at least 30% of active users joining group buys or supply networks), a measurable increase in recorded sales (e.g. 15%+ growth after 6 months of usage), and positive feedback indicating that routine tasks (like bookkeeping or ordering stock) have become easier. **Operational KPIs** such as reduced stockouts and time saved will be collected through user interviews and app analytics. These metrics tie directly to TREP's mission – empowering these businesses with tools to grow sustainably.

## 3. Target Users and Use Cases

**Target Users:** The MVP is targeted at *informal, micro and small enterprises in townships and rural areas*, specifically those identified by the TREP initiative. These are typically owner-operated businesses with 1-10 employees, often family-run, with limited access to formal business management tools. They operate in a variety of sectors, including:

* **Spaza Shops (General Dealers):** Small neighborhood convenience stores selling groceries and everyday items. These users need to track daily sales (mostly cash), manage fast-moving consumer goods inventory, and reorder stock frequently. They often travel to wholesalers for stock – TOSS can help by enabling group purchases and linking to delivery services. *Use Case:* Sindi, a spaza shop owner, uses the mobile app each day to record sales of bread, milk, and airtime. She checks her dashboard in the evening to see which products sold out, gets an **auto-alert when stock is low**, and joins a group order with other shopkeepers to buy bulk maize meal at a discount next week.

* **Clothing, Leather & Textile Micro-producers:** Tailors, seamstresses, cobblers, and small-scale fashion businesses. They require a lightweight CRM to manage customer orders/measurements, inventory for raw materials (fabrics, leather, thread), and basic accounting for income and expenses. *Use Case:* Thabo is a township tailor who makes school uniforms. He uses TOSS to record orders from local schools (customer details and measurements in CRM), track his fabric and buttons inventory, and issue simple invoices. The **AI assistant** recommends stocking up on a specific fabric in June based on upcoming school demand (sales forecasting), and suggests a fellow TREP-supported textile supplier for bulk fabric purchasing (supply match feature).

* **Small-Scale Bakeries and Confectioneries:** Micro bakeries that produce bread, cakes or snacks to sell in the community. They need to manage recipes (bill of materials) in a simple way, track ingredients inventory (flour, sugar, yeast), and handle both **B2C sales and B2B supply** to spazas or schools. *Use Case:* Mary runs a home bakery making bread and vetkoek. In TOSS, she monitors her ingredient levels; the system sends an **automated alert when flour stocks run low**, and even provides an *inventory recommendation* to order extra flour ahead of a holiday week (based on sales trends). Mary also uses the collaboration module to **list her bakery as a supplier**, allowing nearby spaza shops on TOSS to find her and order bread daily – a peer supply chain match that grows her sales.

* **Autobody Repairers, Mechanics & Auto Spares:** Mechanics and panel beaters often operate informal garages. Key needs include job tracking (service orders for vehicles), parts inventory management (spare parts, oils), and supplier coordination to source parts. *Use Case:* Jabu owns a small auto repair workshop. He uses TOSS on a tablet to log each repair job (customer and vehicle info), track parts used, and manage his inventory of spare parts. When he needs a part he doesn't have, the **peer-to-peer network** in TOSS can suggest another nearby spare shop or scrapyard that has it in stock (supply chain matching). Jabu can also pool resources by sharing a costly diagnostic tool with two other mechanics via the app's resource sharing board.

* **Butcheries:** Small butcher shops handling fresh meat require inventory by weight, sales tracking, and possibly cold storage management. They benefit from group purchasing livestock or bulk meat and coordinating deliveries. *Use Case:* Naledi's butchery uses TOSS to log daily meat sales and manage inventory of different cuts. The system's AI forecasting notices increased demand for chicken ahead of a local holiday and suggests ordering more. Through TOSS's group buying feature, Naledi joins with two other butcheries to buy a larger quantity of chicken from a wholesale supplier, getting a better price and sharing transport costs.

* **Tshisanyamas and Cooked Food Vendors:** Informal food stalls and braai (barbecue) stands. They need simple POS for daily sales and expense tracking for ingredients (meat, charcoal, spices). Collaboration could let them pool orders for meat or share refrigeration space. *Use Case:* In a village, three cooked-food stall owners form a group on TOSS to purchase a whole cow from a farmer – a classic **resource pooling and group purchase** scenario. TOSS facilitates splitting the cost and inventory (each records their portion of meat stock). Each owner tracks their individual sales of meals, and the system provides insights like which days are busiest (business insights) to help them plan staffing and prep.

* **Fruit and Vegetable Hawkers:** Street vendors selling produce, often sourced from city markets or farms. They would use TOSS to manage their stock (perishable goods tracking), daily cash sales, and to coordinate buying trips. *Use Case:* A group of fruit hawkers in a rural area use the app to collectively order produce from a regional market. One driver is hired to bring back stock for everyone, with orders and cost-sharing organized through TOSS. Each hawker's inventory is updated upon receipt, and they get **alerts for produce nearing spoilage** or unsold (so they can run a quick discount sale).

* **Personal Care Services:** Hair salons, barbers, and beauty services in townships. They schedule client appointments, manage inventory of hair products, and record sales of services and products. *Use Case:* Lerato's hair salon uses TOSS to book client appointments (the CRM module logs customer preferences), send reminder messages (through an integrated messaging API), and track sales of hair products. The system's analytics identify her best-selling product (hair oil) and alert her when it's time to restock, as well as flagging times of day that are under-utilized so she can run promotions.

All these users share common constraints: limited time for admin, often only a smartphone for computing, and unreliable connectivity. TOSS is designed to be **extremely intuitive and localized**, requiring minimal training. The platform will support English initially (with simple language), but uses icons and a clean UI suitable for users with basic literacy or limited tech experience. By focusing on these TREP-backed sectors, we ensure the MVP addresses real, high-impact use cases. Each feature in the system (from inventory alerts to group buying) is mapped to these concrete scenarios to maximize relevance and adoption.

## 4. MVP Functional Requirements

The MVP will deliver a focused set of functional features that cover the essential needs of our target users. Each requirement is described in terms of what the system *must do* for the user, and ties back to enabling better business management or collaboration. The core functional areas are **ERP modules**, **AI-powered tools**, and **collaboration features**, all accessible via mobile and web.

**Core ERP Modules:** (Based on proven ERP frameworks like ERPNext, but simplified)

* **Inventory Management:** Users can create and manage a catalog of products or materials, with current stock levels and units. The system supports low-stock thresholds and will **generate alerts when inventory is below re-order levels**. Basic multi-location support is included (for example, a spaza shop owner can track stock at the shop and a small storeroom). The inventory module will handle adjustments (e.g. wastage, spoilage) and simple stock transfer if needed. *Reordering rules* and tracking are core to this module. For MVP, batch numbers or advanced warehouse features are optional – we focus on quantity tracking and notifications. The **AI inventory recommender** is integrated here: it analyzes sales velocity and seasonality to suggest optimal re-stock quantities or **recommended new products** to stock (e.g. "Customers are buying more cold drinks this month; consider increasing your stock of beverages").

* **Sales & Point-of-Sale (POS):** A lightweight POS system will allow quick recording of sales transactions. This includes selecting items sold (with automatic stock deduction), recording the price (with tax if applicable), and noting payment method (cash, mobile money, etc.). For many micro-enterprises, printing receipts is not required, but the system can generate digital receipts or order confirmations (to be sent via WhatsApp/SMS or shown on screen). The sales module is linked to accounting for revenue logging and to inventory for stock updates. It also doubles as a simple **CRM for sales**, capturing customer info when needed (e.g. wholesale clients or regular customers for credit tracking). The user should be able to apply discounts and see daily sales totals easily. Over time, the system can accumulate sales data to provide insights like top-selling items or peak sales hours. The **CRM aspect** will at least include a customer contact list and basic opportunity/lead tracking, integrated with sales orders. (For instance, a mechanic can record a customer's request as a "job lead" and convert it to a work order/invoice when done – analogous to lead-to-order conversion.)

* **Accounting & Finance:** The MVP will not attempt a full complex accounting package, but it will include essential bookkeeping features. This means recording of income (sales) and expenses (purchases, operating costs) in a simplified general ledger. We will use a pre-configured **Chart of Accounts** suitable for micro businesses – possibly a cash-based accounting structure with categories like Sales, Cost of Goods, Expenses, etc. The system will support invoice creation (for cases where a formal invoice is needed) and logging of payments. It will also allow the user to see basic financial reports: daily cash summary, profit & loss for a period, and outstanding customer/supplier balances if credit is extended. Key financial capabilities from ERPNext's accounting module such as invoice generation, payment reminders, and bank reconciliation are inspirations, but for MVP we focus on cash sales and expense tracking. Automation like **auto-generated invoices when sales orders are fulfilled** can be included to save time. The goal is to give owners visibility into their finances without requiring an accountant – e.g. "What were my total sales and expenses this week?".

* **Purchasing & Supplier Management:** To facilitate **procurement** (especially group buying), the system will allow creating Purchase Orders and keeping a list of suppliers. MVP will support the user in documenting what they need to buy, either individually or as part of a group. For example, a shop owner can create a purchase order for 10 cases of soda; if it's a group purchase, multiple users' orders can be aggregated. The purchasing module includes features to record supplier info, create and send **Requests for Quotes (RFQs)**, and log purchase bills. While full automation (like auto-PO on low stock) is a future consideration, MVP may include a simple trigger: when inventory falls below a threshold, prompt the user to create a purchase order (possibly through the AI assistant). Integration with the collaboration engine is key: if the user opts in, their needed items can be visible (in aggregate form) to partners or group coordinators to arrange bulk orders.

*(Note: Modules like Manufacturing, HR, Project Management, etc., are **out of scope for MVP** because our initial users typically do not require complex manufacturing or formal HR systems. These can be added as needed in future updates, see Roadmap.)*

**Mobile-First and Web Access:**

* The platform must be fully usable via a **mobile app (Flutter)** as well as a responsive web interface (Nuxt.js). **Mobile is prioritized** since most target users will use Android smartphones as their main tool. The mobile app will have an **intuitive dashboard** that gives a snapshot of the business: e.g. today's sales, top products, tasks or alerts pending. Users can navigate to different modules (Sales, Inventory, etc.) through a simple menu or tab interface. The design will follow UI best practices for low-tech users: large buttons, clear labels (in English with minimal jargon), and iconography relevant to the local context (for example, a cart icon for sales, a shelf icon for inventory). Real-time updates and notifications are crucial – the app will push alerts such as **"Low Stock on Product X" or "New group purchase offer available"** via in-app notification (and optionally SMS for important alerts). The web portal will offer similar functionality primarily for those who have PCs or for back-office tasks (e.g. exporting data).

* **Offline Mode:** Given unreliable connectivity in many townships/rural areas, the mobile app is built with an **offline-first architecture**. Users can **record transactions and lookup information with no internet connection**, and the data will sync to the cloud when connectivity is restored. For example, a hawker can record sales all day in a remote village and once he goes to a network area, the app syncs and backs up his data. Technical details include a local database on the device and a background sync service (with conflict resolution rules if data was edited both offline and online). The result is a seamless UX where "no internet" does not halt the business – this is absolutely critical in our context. In offline mode, certain features like AI recommendations or real-time collaboration might be limited, but core operations (sales, inventory updates) will always be available.

**Embedded AI Tools:** AI functionality in TOSS is not a separate module but *woven into the workflows* to assist users proactively. Key AI-enabled features in the MVP:

* **Inventory Recommendations:** The system analyzes sales trends, seasonality, and stock levels to provide smart suggestions. For instance, it can recommend reordering a product before it runs out, or suggest dropping a product that consistently sells poorly. These recommendations appear on the dashboard (e.g. "You are selling 20% more cold drinks this month – consider increasing your stock of cold beverages.") and in the inventory screen as hints next to each item. The AI uses historical data and possibly external factors (season, local events) to forecast demand. *Predictive models* help **prevent stockouts and overstocks** by advising the user with data-driven insights (similar to how modern ERPs use AI/ML for anticipatory analytics).

* **Sales Forecasting:** The platform will include a basic forecasting tool that projects future sales (daily or weekly) based on historical sales data and patterns. For example, it can show a simple chart of expected sales next week, highlighting any peak days. This helps users plan inventory and staffing. Over time, this could evolve into more advanced demand forecasting, but MVP will keep it understandable – possibly phrased as "Next week's projected sales: R5000 (10% higher than this week)." The forecasting algorithm can also incorporate trends (e.g., increased demand end of month when social grants are paid out) which many informal traders know anecdotally – turning that into a quantified insight is valuable.

* **Business Insights & Alerts:** TOSS will monitor the business data and automatically alert the user to notable events or anomalies. These **automated alerts** could include: unusual drop in sales ("Your sales in the past 3 days are 30% lower than average – check if there's an issue"), top-selling item of the week, gross profit margin warnings (if expenses are spiking), or reminders like "rent is due tomorrow" if recorded as a recurring expense. The aim is to act as a virtual business advisor keeping an eye on things. For example, if inventory value is high but sales are low, an alert might suggest a promotion. Many modern ERP systems embed such AI-driven anomaly detection – identifying outliers and prompting action – we will leverage similar techniques.

* **Chatbot Support:** A conversational AI chatbot will be integrated into both the mobile and web interfaces to assist users. This chatbot (accessible via a "Help" or "Ask TOSS" button) will answer user questions about using the system ("How do I add a new product?"), and potentially provide business advice based on data ("Which product gave me the highest profit last month?"). It will use natural language processing so that users can ask in English (or another supported language in future) and get instant answers. Initially, the chatbot's knowledge base will cover the application's functionality (acting as an interactive user manual) and common business queries by pulling from the user's own data. For example, asking "How were my sales today?" would prompt the bot to show the sales total and maybe compare it to yesterday. This feature reduces the learning curve and provides a form of on-demand training. As the underlying AI, we might use a small language model or scripted Q\&A pairs for reliability in MVP. The chatbot can also escalate to human support if it cannot answer something.

**Collaboration Module:** One of the defining features of TOSS, setting it apart from typical ERPs, is the **Collaboration suite** that connects businesses to leverage collective benefits. MVP will implement the following sub-features:

* **Peer-to-Peer Supply Chain Matching:** This is essentially an in-app network or marketplace where users can find and connect with other businesses for supply needs. The system will allow a user to publish certain data points (opt-in and controlled) such as the products they sell or need. Using this data, TOSS can **match needs to haves**. For example, a spaza shop owner searching for "bread supplier" will see nearby small bakeries or wholesalers on the platform, with ratings or basic info, enabling B2B sourcing. Conversely, a small manufacturer (like a clothing maker) can find local retailers who might buy their products. The matching is **data-driven** – it might use tags or categories of goods and location proximity to suggest connections. Over time, as more data is collected, this could evolve into a recommendation system ("X% of businesses like yours source from Supplier Y"). MVP will include a simple search/browse interface for the business network, profiles for each business (with business type, products/services, contact info), and the ability to send a message or request. All communications could be done via an integrated messaging or by exchanging contact details through the platform.

* **Group Purchasing (Bulk Buying):** TOSS will include functionality for **group buy initiatives** where multiple small businesses combine their orders to achieve bulk rates or share logistics. MVP will support the creation of a "Group Purchase" event: a user (or admin) can initiate a bulk order for a specific item or set of items, specifying details like item, supplier (if known) or target price, deadline to join, and minimum quantity. Other businesses can then join this group purchase by adding the quantity they want. Once the deadline hits or the target quantity is reached, the order can be finalized and an organizer (either one of the business owners or a facilitator) places the actual bulk order with the supplier. The system will then split the stock and cost information back to each participant. *Example:* Three spazas form a bulk order of 1000 loaves of bread from a bakery; individually they could never reach that volume for a discount, but together they can negotiate, and the system helps track each one ordered 300, 300, 400 loaves and owes the respective amount. We will provide templates for group purchase agreements and possibly integrate with payment so participants can pay their share via the app. The benefit is directly **reducing unit costs and transport costs** for participants. Metrics of success (like how many group orders completed) tie to our collaboration goals.

* **Resource Pooling & Shared Services:** Many micro-enterprises have underutilized resources or lack resources that others might share. The platform will provide a section for **posting and requesting shared resources**. This could include equipment (e.g. a delivery vehicle, generator, fridge space) or services (e.g. a shared bookkeeper or security guard for a market). MVP implementation can be a simple bulletin board style: users create a "Resource Offer" or "Resource Needed" post with a description, availability, and contact. For example, one shop can post "Spare freezer space available, can share with someone for R50/week" or a group of vendors might collectively hire a single night guard via the platform. The system could also use the matching algorithm here: if someone posts a need for a delivery van on Fridays, and another user has a van idle on Fridays, it can notify them. While the platform won't intermediate the transactions in MVP (users will arrange the details offline), it will **facilitate discovery and connection**. Over time this could evolve into formalized shared logistics or co-op services scheduling.

* **Collaboration Analytics:** Although not a user-facing "feature", it's worth noting that the platform will collect anonymized data on prices, demand, etc., which can be fed back in a helpful way. For instance, if multiple users join a bulk purchase, the system could show the average price achieved versus retail, giving them insight into savings. This reinforces the value of collaboration and encourages continued use.

**Integration and External APIs:** Even in the MVP, certain integrations will vastly enhance functionality:

* **Payments Integration:** The system should integrate with popular payment methods to enable digital payments. For example, integration with mobile money or QR code payment providers in South Africa (like SnapScan or Vodacom's M-Pesa, etc.), and card payments via a third-party if the user has a card reader (like Yoco or iKhokha). MVP will likely implement a **payment gateway API** to record payments digitally – for instance, generating a payment link or QR that the customer can use. This helps formalize sales and gives users access to e-payment even if they are cash-based (they can start accepting e-wallet or card). While only \~4% of these businesses currently use digital payments, having this feature built-in prepares them for the growing cashless trend. The integration will also simplify things like sending payment reminders or confirming receipts in the accounting module. *Note:* Actual funds flow and KYC will depend on the provider's requirements – TOSS acts as an initiator of transactions via secure APIs.

* **Logistics and Delivery:** To support stock deliveries (especially relevant in group buying or supplier orders), TOSS can integrate with local courier or delivery services. An API integration with a logistics platform would allow, for example, automatically scheduling a pickup/delivery when a group purchase is completed or when a supplier ships goods. MVP may include a basic integration (for example, with a service like PAXI or a courier API) to calculate delivery fees or track deliveries of stock. In the collaboration module, a user could request a delivery quote to bring bulk goods from a wholesaler to the township, and the system could fetch that info. This ties into reducing the burden where traders currently travel themselves to get stock – if delivery can be coordinated via the app, that's a huge efficiency gain.

* **Messaging and Notifications:** The platform will integrate with SMS/WhatsApp APIs to send critical notifications and enable communication. For instance, group purchase invitations or confirmations can be sent via WhatsApp message to ensure everyone sees it. Also, a business owner might want to send an SMS campaign to their customers (if they have their contacts) – e.g. "This week special on rice at my shop". MVP will offer simple messaging capabilities: likely an integration with an SMS gateway for low-volume messages (for alerts) and possibly the WhatsApp Business API for richer communication. The chatbot might also use these channels to answer questions if the user is offline in the app but online on WhatsApp, for example.

All integrations will be abstracted behind the platform's own API layer, making it easy to swap providers if needed. ERPNext demonstrates strong integration capabilities with payment gateways, email, and shipping providers – we take a cue from that to ensure TOSS is not a siloed system but can connect with the external world.

In summary, the MVP functional scope is ambitious yet focused on **high-impact features**: we cover the *must-haves* of running a small business (track sales, stock, money) and layer on *innovations* that truly empower users (AI suggestions and a collaborative network). By carefully designing these features for simplicity and relevance, the MVP will deliver immediate value to TREP-supported entrepreneurs and build a foundation for future growth of the platform.

## 5. User Flow and Interface Overview

This section describes how a typical user would interact with the TOSS platform, illustrating the primary flows through the system. The design emphasizes **ease-of-use, minimal steps for common tasks, and surfacing of important information on the dashboard**.

**Onboarding Flow:** New users will be onboarded through a simple sign-up process. Given many users may not have email, we will allow sign-up via **mobile number (OTP verification)** or using an existing Gmail if they have one. During onboarding, the user creates their business profile – entering basic info like business name, type (selected from categories such as Spaza, Bakery, etc.), and location (which can help with collaboration features). There will be an option to opt-in to the collaboration network directory (so others can discover their business). After signup, a quick **setup wizard** helps them input a few key data: e.g. *add your first few products or services*, *enter current stock levels*, and *record any opening cash balance*. This ensures that when they start using the system, the data is already somewhat populated. Onboarding will also include an interactive tutorial (or the chatbot guiding them) covering how to record a sale and check a report – the two most fundamental actions.

**Dashboard (Home) Screen:** Once logged in (mobile or web), the user is greeted with a **Dashboard** showing high-level metrics and alerts. The dashboard is designed to be scannable in seconds, answering the questions: *"How is my business doing right now? What do I need to pay attention to?"* Key components might include:

* **Sales Summary:** Today's sales total and number of transactions (with comparison to yesterday or last week).
* **Top Product:** Highlight the best-selling item of the day or week.
* **Cash Position:** If they track cash, show current cash-on-hand vs expected (this helps catch discrepancies).
* **Alerts/Notifications:** A list of the most recent important alerts, e.g. *"Stock low: Eggs down to 5 units"*, *"Group Buy: Order for flour closes today"*, *"New message from supplier XYZ"*. These will often be generated by the AI or collaboration features.
* Perhaps a **tip of the day or insight** (like a small chatbot snippet: "Your expenses were high last week due to electricity—consider monitoring utility usage").

The user can tap any of these sections for deeper detail (e.g., tapping the sales summary opens the Sales module with a breakdown chart).

**Recording a Sale (POS flow):** This is the most frequent action for many users, so it must be ultra-fast:

1. User taps on "Sales" (or a quick "New Sale" button on the dashboard).
2. They get a simple interface to enter sale details. On mobile, this could be a list of products with "+" buttons to add to a cart (for shops), or a quick entry form for amount (for services). We'll support both itemized sales and quick sales. For example, a spaza owner can scan a barcode (if available) or select "Bread" from the list, enter quantity, then "Milk", etc., then press Complete. A hairdresser might just enter "Hairstyle service – R50".
3. (Optional) The system asks for payment method. If cash, just confirm amount received; if digital, it might open a payment interface (like display QR code for customer or confirm mobile money payment).
4. Sale is saved – inventory reduces automatically, and the transaction is logged in accounting. The screen then offers to print or share a receipt if needed (most likely skipped in informal context unless requested).
5. The user is returned to the sales list or dashboard. The dashboard's sales figure updates in real-time.

This flow should work offline too – if offline, any attempt to process a digital payment will either queue until online or inform the user that payment must be taken in cash (depending on capability).

**Inventory Update / Stock Check flow:** Another common activity is updating stock (e.g. when new stock arrives, or doing a stock count):

1. User goes to **Inventory** module. They see a list of their products/materials with current quantities. There may be color coding on quantities (red if low, green if sufficient).
2. To update stock (purchase received), they tap the item and choose "Add stock" – entering the quantity received (and optionally cost if they want to record the purchase expense at the same time). Alternatively, if they created a Purchase Order in the system, they can mark it as received to automatically update relevant items.
3. The system updates the quantity and generates any necessary accounting entries (like increasing stock asset, etc., though in MVP accounting might be simplified).
4. If the new level resolves a low-stock alert, that alert is cleared. If an item added was previously out-of-stock, and there were any pending customer orders for it (in a future version), those could be flagged.
5. The user can also use this interface to do a quick **stock audit**: if something doesn't match (the user counts shelf items and it's different from the system), they can adjust it (with reason "count adjustment").

**Using AI Insights:** The AI suggestions are designed to fit into the natural flow. For example, when the user is viewing an item in Inventory, they might see a suggestion like *"This item sells faster than its restock rate. Consider increasing your reorder quantity."* with an option to act (maybe a button "Adjust reorder level"). In the Sales module, a chart might highlight a trend: *"Your evening sales are 20% higher than morning – perhaps open earlier or stock breakfast items?"* The user can choose to ignore or follow these insights. We will monitor how often users follow AI suggestions as a measure of effectiveness. The **chatbot** can be invoked by the user anytime (e.g. via a chat icon). For example, if the user is confused about how to record an expense, they can ask the bot in plain text, *"How do I enter my electricity bill?"* and the bot will respond with step-by-step guidance, or even deep-link to the expense entry form. This greatly smooths out the learning curve.

**Collaboration interactions:** The collaboration features introduce multi-user flows:

* *Group Purchase:* Suppose a user sees a **Group Purchase Invite** on their dashboard: *"Group buying cooking oil – 5 participants, R20/L expected price, join?"*. If interested, the user clicks it, sees details, and enters how many units they want (e.g. 20 liters). The system confirms their pledge. Later, they'll get a notification if the group order is proceeding and instructions (perhaps "Please drop R400 off at X or pay via app" if payment integration is there). The UI for group buys will show status (how many have joined, how many needed, time left). If the user wants to start a group buy, they go to the Collaboration module, choose "Start Group Purchase", fill in item details and either a specific supplier or an open proposal. This then sends out an alert to either everyone or selected businesses in their area/sector. Managing these flows requires clarity: a progress bar for how close they are to goal, and clear prompts when action is needed (like finalize, or distribution ready).
* *Supply Matching:* If a user wants to find a supplier or partner, they go to the **Network** screen (within Collaboration). It might show categories or allow search. For example, a shop owner types "flour supplier" – the system lists perhaps a local bakery co-op or a wholesaler contact. They tap one to see details, maybe chat or call them (TOSS could open WhatsApp or a phone call directly for convenience). Similarly, if a user listed themselves as a supplier (say the bakery), they might get a notification *"5 nearby shops searched for bread suppliers this week – make sure your profile is up to date!"*.
* *Resource Pooling:* A user can browse a board of offers/requests. E.g., in the app they see *"Offers: 1-ton Truck available on Sundays"* and *"Requests: Freezer storage needed for 20kg meat, ongoing"*. If they find a match, they can tap to message that user. Messaging could be done via an in-app chat or simply by exchanging contact info. MVP might implement a basic chat within the app for those who are connected through a collaboration feature (like a temporary chat room for each group buy, and direct messaging for resource share discussion). The UI will emphasize safety and consent – only share details when both parties agree.

**User Permissions and Multi-user (if any):** Many of these micro businesses are single-user systems (one owner). MVP will assume a one-user-per-business model for simplicity. In future, we might add the ability for an owner to invite an employee or family member with restricted access (e.g. a cashier who can only record sales, not see financial reports). The architecture will support multiple roles, but UI for role management is likely post-MVP. For now, one login = one business.

**Interface Design Principles:**

* Keep screens uncluttered with a focus on the primary action. For instance, the sales entry screen should not show accounting details; the accounting module can show those behind the scenes.
* Use visuals where possible: small charts for trends, icons for modules, maybe illustrations in empty states (like if no data, an image encouraging them to add info).
* Language will be tailored to user familiarity – avoid accounting jargon like "receivables ledger"; instead use "Customers Owe You" or "Money to Collect".
* Provide confirmation and success messages. e.g., after saving a sale: "Sale recorded! 📦 Stock updated. (Undo)".
* Ensure efficient navigation: a bottom nav bar (or tab bar) could present the main sections (Dashboard, Sales, Inventory, Collaboration, More...), and context-specific fab buttons for adding entries quickly.

**Example User Journey:**

*Nomsa is a fruit & veg hawker.* In the morning, Nomsa opens TOSS on her phone. On the dashboard she sees an alert that apples are low in stock. She clicks it and is taken to the inventory item "Apples" – she sees only 5kg left, and TOSS suggests "Your apples often sell out by Thursday. Consider restocking \~20kg.". Nomsa decides to join a group purchase for fruit instead of buying alone. She goes to Collaboration -> Group Purchase and sees one active for "Mixed Vegetables from City Market (Transport on Friday)". She joins it, requesting 20kg apples and 10kg oranges. The app confirms her pledge. She then goes to Sales as customers arrive; for each sale, she taps items: 1kg apples, 2kg potatoes, etc., and records the sale. At day's end, she checks the dashboard – sales were R800 today (20% higher than yesterday, a stat shown with a green arrow). She also gets a chatbot message: "You sold out of apples. Increase your next order to avoid lost sales.". The next day, she receives a notification that the group purchase order is being placed and she needs to pay R300 by tomorrow; she uses the app's payment link to do an EFT to the organizer. On Friday, she receives a message that the stock is ready for pickup at the taxi rank. She marks in the app that she received her apples and oranges (inventory automatically updates). Over the month, Nomsa notices her revenue increasing and less unsold stock waste, thanks to these timely insights and the cheaper stock she's getting via group buys. Importantly, she finds the app easy – almost like using WhatsApp – and the community aspect motivates her to log in daily, not just for her own business but to see opportunities with others.

This user flow illustrates how all pieces (core ERP tasks and new collaborative features) come together in a coherent user experience. The interface supports quick actions for daily tasks and deeper interaction for collaborative or analytical tasks, all while maintaining a gentle learning curve through tooltips, chatbot help, and sensible defaults.

## 6. Technical Architecture

The TOSS platform will be built on a modern, scalable architecture that balances the need for robust enterprise features with the agility required for an MVP. We adopt a **microservices architecture** inspired by Microsoft's eShopOnContainers reference application, modular ERP design principles from ERPNext, and an event-driven approach to enable a responsive, loosely-coupled system. Below we outline the key components and technologies:

&#x20;*Figure: High-level Microservices Architecture – Each service (Identity, Catalog/Inventory, Sales/Orders, etc.) has its own database and communicates via an event bus. API Gateways (or BFFs) separate client-specific requests (mobile vs web), ensuring a secure and optimized pipeline for users.*

* **Microservice-Oriented Design:** The system will be broken into multiple self-contained services, each responsible for a specific domain of functionality, similar to the eShopOnContainers model. For MVP, the likely microservices are:

  * **Identity/Auth Service:** Manages user accounts, authentication (probably via JWT tokens or OAuth2), and tenant management (each business is a tenant). This could leverage existing solutions (e.g. IdentityServer or Azure AD B2C) for robust security. It ensures every API call is authenticated and enforces roles/permissions if we introduce them.
  * **Catalog/Inventory Service:** Handles all product/item data and stock levels. Owns the Inventory domain – responsible for product CRUD, inventory transactions (stock in/out). It has its own database (likely PostgreSQL) with tables for items, stock ledger, etc. This service might also handle pricing info for products.
  * **Sales/Order Service:** Responsible for sales transactions, order management, and linking to CRM info. It creates sales records, updates status (open, paid, etc.), and coordinates with Inventory (via events) to decrement stock. Invoices could be generated here too. This service ensures financial records for sales are consistent.
  * **Accounting Service:** Manages general ledger entries, expenses, and basic financial reports. It could subscribe to events like "SaleCompleted" or "PurchaseRecorded" to automatically post to the ledger. Alternatively, for MVP, we might integrate accounting into Sales and Inventory services to reduce complexity, but conceptually it's a separate concern.
  * **Collaboration Service:** Powers the collaboration module (group purchases, resource posts, matchmaking). This service will maintain data about group order sessions, membership, and interface with others (like creating a combined Purchase Order in the Purchasing service if needed). It may also run background jobs analyzing data to find matches (e.g., scanning inventory needs across businesses to suggest a group buy).
  * **AI/Analytics Service:** A specialized microservice (or a set of microservices) for AI functions – forecasting, recommendations, and chatbot Q\&A. This service might run Python-based ML models or connect to AI APIs. It will consume data from other services (perhaps via an event stream or periodic queries) to train models and produce predictions. For instance, a "ForecastService" could listen for "DailySalesTotals" events and update a forecast model for each business, then store suggestions which the client UI can fetch. By isolating AI logic here, we can scale it or update algorithms without disturbing transaction processing.
  * **Notification/Communication Service:** Handles outgoing communications – emails, SMS, push notifications, WhatsApp – in a unified way. When other services need to notify a user, they call this service. It encapsulates third-party messaging APIs and ensures compliance (e.g., respecting user notification preferences).

  Each microservice **owns its data** (database) and will expose a well-defined API (typically RESTful endpoints) for its functionality. They will also publish and subscribe to a **message bus** for inter-service events, which is critical for decoupling.

* **Backend Technology – .NET Core:** We have chosen **ASP.NET Core (latest .NET 7/8)** for implementing the microservices. .NET is a mature, high-performance framework ideal for enterprise logic, and it aligns well with the eShopOnContainers architecture (which is a .NET reference) and cross-platform deployment. Each microservice will be a .NET Web API project, possibly using minimal APIs or MVC controllers as needed. Domain-driven design (DDD) patterns will be applied where complexity warrants (e.g., Sales might use an aggregate for Order -> OrderLines, etc.), but we will keep the MVP implementation as straightforward as possible. .NET Core offers excellent support for containerization (Dockers) and cloud deployment, which fits our DevOps strategy.

* **Frontend Technology – Nuxt.js and Flutter:** The **web interface** will be built with **Nuxt.js (Vue.js)**, a framework that provides server-side rendering (for SEO if needed) and a smooth developer experience. Nuxt will consume the backend APIs to render the dashboard, forms, and reports for users who access via browsers. We anticipate the web app being used by slightly more advanced users or for more detailed tasks (maybe on a PC at home or by support staff). The **mobile app** will be built with **Flutter**, allowing a single codebase for Android (and iOS if needed). Flutter is chosen for its excellent UI capabilities and offline support (it can easily integrate a local database and handle sync). The Flutter app will also communicate with the backend via REST (or GraphQL if we choose that route) through the API Gateway. By using Flutter, we ensure the mobile experience is fluid and can work offline-first, and we have the flexibility to compile to Android APKs easily (critical since many users may sideload or we distribute outside the Play Store initially if needed for testing). The UI components in Flutter will store data locally (SQLite or Hive DB) for offline mode and synchronize when online.

* **API Gateway & BFF:** To simplify client interactions and improve security, we will implement an **API Gateway** as an entry point for all client requests. In fact, we might use the BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) pattern – i.e., have one gateway optimized for mobile and one for web if their needs diverge. For MVP, a single gateway service might suffice, handling tasks like authentication, request routing to appropriate microservices, and response aggregation. For example, when the mobile app dashboard loads, instead of the app calling 5 different services, it can call one Dashboard API on the gateway, which internally fetches data from Sales, Inventory, etc., and composes a single payload. This reduces round-trips over mobile networks. The gateway can also enforce rate limiting and serve as a point to implement cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching of static responses, etc.). **Security** is enhanced because services are not exposed directly – the gateway will validate tokens and only forward authorized calls.

* **Event-Driven Infrastructure:** At the heart of inter-service communication will be a **message broker** (event bus). We plan to use either **Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ** (RabbitMQ was used in eShopOnContainers). For MVP, RabbitMQ might be simpler to set up, providing reliable message delivery with routing keys. Services will publish **integration events** when something noteworthy happens (e.g., "SaleCompleted" event from Sales Service, "InventoryLow" event from Inventory Service). Other services can subscribe: the Accounting service might subscribe to sales events to record revenue, the Collaboration service could subscribe to inventory low events across multiple shops to identify a common need (for group buys), etc. This event-driven pattern ensures **loose coupling** – services don't have to call each other directly and wait; they just emit events and continue, improving performance and resilience. Moreover, it allows adding new reactions in future without changing the original service (just add a new subscriber). The event messages will be lightweight JSON payloads, and we'll design a schema for each type of event. We will also consider **outbox pattern** for reliability so that events are not lost if a service fails after a transaction.

* **Database and Storage:** We choose **PostgreSQL** as the primary relational database for most services (one per service). PostgreSQL is open-source, robust, and has features like JSON support if we need schemaless flexibility, and it's well-supported by .NET (EF Core or Dapper). Each service's DB will contain only the tables relevant to that service – for example, Inventory DB has Product, StockTransaction, etc.; Sales DB has Orders, OrderLines, Payments; etc. We will implement **database migrations** for each service (ensuring we can deploy updates without downtime). For caching and fast data, we incorporate **Redis**. Redis will be used in multiple ways:

  * As a caching layer for frequently accessed data or expensive queries (e.g., caching the dashboard summary for a minute or two, or caching product catalog data to speed up the POS).
  * As a session store or token store if needed (though JWT might not require server session).
  * Possibly for the shopping cart or group purchase assembling (since Redis excels at quick read/writes and can handle things like incrementing counters across users).
  * Also, the offline sync queue on the mobile might use a form of local caching that eventually hits the server; Redis on the server could queue those incoming offline updates for processing.

  For file storage (if we handle any documents, like maybe photos of products or user avatars), we might use cloud storage (AWS S3 or Azure Blob) via an integration, but MVP can also store small files in the database as blobs if needed.

* **Local Caching and Offline Strategy:** On the client side, as mentioned, we'll employ a **local database** (SQLite for Flutter, IndexedDB for the web PWA if we go that route) to ensure offline availability. Syncing is a complex problem, but MVP will simplify: last write wins for conflicting edits, and we'll try to avoid conflicts by scoping user roles (if it's just one user using one device mostly). The app will tag each data entry with timestamps and maybe a GUID, so when syncing, the server can reconcile. The local caching strategy also means the app can instantly load last known data on startup (critical for a fast UX), updating in background. We might implement a sync module in the app that listens for connectivity changes or uses periodic intervals to push/pull data. The tech architecture supports offline by ensuring the server APIs can accept sync batches (e.g., the mobile app might send 10 sales at once when online).

* **External API Integrations:** The system will expose **internal RESTful APIs** for the frontends, but it will also integrate with third-party APIs for payment, SMS, etc., as described in functional requirements. We will likely create **microservice clients** or use middleware to call those external services. For example, a Payment Integration Module (could be part of Accounting or its own service) to handle calls to a payment gateway (like calling PayFast or a banking API to initiate a transaction). Similarly, a Messaging integration inside the Notification service to call an SMS gateway API. These will be behind service interfaces, so if we switch providers it doesn't affect higher-level logic.

* **AI Microservices & Model Hosting:** The AI components may have their own specialized stack. We can implement the recommendation and forecasting logic within a .NET service, but often Python libraries or TensorFlow models might be preferred for ML. We have two approaches:

  1. Use an embedded ML library in .NET (ML.NET or some simple logic) for things like time-series forecasting.
  2. Spin up a separate **AI service in Python** (with FastAPI or Flask) that the AI microservice calls, or even package models as Docker containers (for example, a TensorFlow Serving container for a trained model).

  Given MVP scope, we might use simpler heuristic models (like moving average forecasts) directly in .NET for now – which is easier to maintain. But we architect the AI as separate logical service regardless, so it can be replaced or scaled. This service might also utilize data stores like a small NoSQL DB to store analytic results per user (or even use the PostgreSQL of each domain service – but better to keep analytics results separate to avoid mixing loads).

* **Security & Compliance:** Security is paramount, especially if we handle financial data and personal info. Each microservice's data is isolated to minimize blast radius of any issue. Communication between services (APIs and events) will happen within a trusted network or via secure channels. For external exposure, the API Gateway will enforce **HTTPS for all client communications**, using TLS 1.3, and we will implement robust auth (JWT tokens with proper signing, refresh token mechanism if needed for long sessions, etc.). We'll follow OWASP guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities (SQL injection – mitigated by using ORMs or parameterized queries, XSS – mitigated by frontend frameworks auto-escaping and secure coding, etc.). User passwords (if any) will be hashed with strong algorithms (or we use phone OTP with no password to avoid that risk).

  Compliance with **POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act)** is a critical requirement since we handle personal and business data in South Africa. POPIA is akin to GDPR in ensuring data privacy and security. Our architecture will ensure:

  * **Data Minimization:** We only collect data that is needed for the platform's function (e.g. we don't ask for unnecessary personal data). All personal/sensitive data fields will be identified and handled carefully.
  * **Consent:** Users will explicitly agree to a privacy policy on signup (covering what data we collect and why). Any sharing of data in collaboration is opt-in. For example, a business profile visible to others will only show what the user provided for that purpose.
  * **Security Measures:** All personal data in databases will be secured – using encryption at rest for databases if possible, or at least encryption for sensitive fields (like a user's ID number if we ever store it). We'll enforce secure access control – only the business owner (and authorized support admin with permission) can access their business's data. Backups of data will also be encrypted.
  * **Data Breach Preparedness:** The infrastructure will log access and have monitoring so we can detect unusual activity. In case of a breach, POPIA requires notifying authorities and users – our plan will include an incident response procedure.
  * **Hosting Location:** Ideally, to comply with POPIA's cross-border data transfer rules, we would host data within South Africa or in a jurisdiction with adequate protection. If using cloud providers, we'll choose regions accordingly or ensure proper agreements (like AWS in Cape Town region for example).

* **Technical Infrastructure & DevOps:** We plan to containerize the microservices using Docker, which allows easy deployment on cloud or on-premises servers. We may use **Kubernetes** or a simpler container orchestrator to manage scaling and resilience. The microservices architecture naturally allows independent scaling – e.g., if the Sales service is heavily used it can scale out without affecting others.

  For **DevOps**, we'll implement a CI/CD pipeline (using tools like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps) that can build, test, and deploy containers on each commit to certain branches. Automated tests will be crucial for such a distributed system – we will write unit tests for service logic and integration tests for API endpoints. Before releasing MVP, we'll also do load testing to ensure the system can handle expected usage (though each individual business might be small, if we onboard many businesses the multi-tenant load needs consideration).

  Logging and monitoring will be set up via a centralized tool (e.g., ELK stack or Azure Application Insights) capturing logs from all services, correlated by request IDs (especially for tracing through the gateway to services). This helps in debugging and in spotting any performance bottlenecks or errors quickly. We'll also implement basic health checks for each microservice (for example, a `/health` endpoint that the orchestrator pings to ensure the service is up and connecting to its DB).

* **Local Deployment Option:** Considering rural areas, one might wonder if the system can run entirely offline locally. The architecture is cloud-focused (for data sharing), but we assume at least intermittent connectivity. If needed, a local server version could be considered later for areas with zero connectivity (with periodic sync to cloud), but not in MVP scope except the offline client capability.

**Architectural Justification:** This architecture is designed for **scalability and flexibility**. By using microservices and an event bus, we can evolve the platform easily – e.g., adding a new module (like HR or E-commerce in future) as a new service without rewriting the whole system. It also allows different developer teams to work in parallel on different services (which will be relevant as we grow the development team post-MVP). Each service's isolation means we can choose the best technology for it (for now all .NET for uniformity, but in future maybe a service in Python for ML). The use of proven patterns from eShopOnContainers and ERPNext modules ensures we're not reinventing the wheel – for example, **each microservice owning its own data and scaling independently is a modern best practice**, and the use of separate API gateways for web vs mobile ensures optimized communication for each client type.

Finally, this architecture serves both the functional needs and the non-functional requirements (like reliability and compliance). For instance, **high availability** can be achieved by running multiple instances of each service behind load balancers; if one instance goes down, others continue serving. The event-driven approach also inherently supports retry and eventual consistency mechanisms (if a service is down and misses an event, we can replay or handle it when it comes back). We'll design with the understanding that network partitions or outages may happen (especially given our userbase's internet situation) – hence the combination of offline-first client and resilient backend ensures no data loss and continuity of operations.

In summary, the technical architecture of TOSS MVP is a cloud-native, modular system with .NET Core microservices, a Vue/Flutter front-end, and robust integration via events and APIs. It aligns with enterprise software principles (like separation of concerns, scalability) while being right-sized for an MVP serving potentially hundreds of small businesses initially and scaling to thousands as TREP expands adoption.

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

In defining the MVP, we have made several **assumptions** about our users and environment, and we acknowledge certain **constraints** that influence the design:

**User & Market Assumptions:**

* **Smartphone Availability:** We assume target users have access to at least an Android smartphone (OS v7.0 or above) with intermittent internet connectivity. While many township entrepreneurs do use smartphones, this may not be universal. We also assume a basic familiarity with using apps like WhatsApp, so they can navigate a simple app. Those without smartphones might access via a shared device or rely on the web (e.g. at a cyber café), but our design optimizes for mobile-first.
* **Digital Literacy:** We assume a low-to-moderate level of digital literacy. Users might not be familiar with accounting terms or complex software workflows. Hence, we've kept the UI extremely straightforward with guided flows. We also assume willingness to learn if the value is clear – e.g., if we demonstrate that using TOSS can help increase profits, users will invest time to adopt it. However, training and support will be crucial (perhaps TREP field agents can assist in onboarding).
* **Trust and Data Sharing:** It is assumed that users will be open to sharing certain business data on the platform, especially for collaboration purposes, when they see personal benefit. Privacy concerns exist (some informal businesses may fear exposing their income or strategies), so our opt-in design is key. We assume a community effect where, as some benefit from group buying, others will join. But if trust in data handling is broken, users could disengage. We must ensure strong privacy controls to maintain trust.
* **TREP Support:** It's assumed that TREP and associated agencies (like SEDA, SEFA) will actively promote and possibly subsidize the platform's usage (e.g., maybe covering data costs or providing devices in some cases). This support can drive initial user acquisition. We also assume that some of these organizations might provide data or integration opportunities (for example, linking TOSS to a government marketplace or funding scheme in future).

**Technical Assumptions:**

* **Internet Constraints:** We assume network bandwidth in townships/rural areas can be limited (2G/3G in places). That's why offline capability is emphasized. We also assume that at least periodically (daily or weekly), users will come online to sync data, as fully isolated operation beyond a certain point would limit collaboration. Our data sync is optimized for low bandwidth (small JSON payloads, minimal images unless necessary).
* **Device Constraints:** Low-end Android phones often have limited storage and memory. The Flutter app must be optimized (targeting perhaps <50 MB install size if possible, and low memory footprint). We assume devices may be shared (family members using the same phone), which affects how we handle login persistence – likely the app will require login each time if needed to separate concerns.
* **Scale and Load:** For MVP, we assume a moderate user base (perhaps on the order of a few hundred businesses in the pilot, scaling to a few thousand within a year). We don't anticipate millions of users immediately. This assumption means our initial infrastructure can be modest (maybe a single cloud VM or small Kubernetes cluster), but we design the software to scale beyond that if needed. We also assume each business's data volume is small (a shop's transactions per day might be in tens, not thousands), which is manageable. The event and microservices design can handle bursts (like end-of-day many shops syncing at once) due to our message queue buffering.

**Functional Constraints:**

* **Scope Limitation:** By MVP definition, we are *not* covering every possible ERP feature. For example, no dedicated HR/payroll (we assume micro businesses will handle wages outside the system for now), no advanced manufacturing or project management. We focus on the most common denominator processes. Some edge cases may not be handled – e.g., multi-currency transactions (probably not needed within a single country context) or complex tax configurations (we might assume a simplified tax or no VAT accounting in MVP, since many informal businesses are not VAT-registered).
* **Regulatory Constraints:** While informal, some of these businesses might eventually formalize. We consider compliance (POPIA for data privacy is one, which we addressed). If users formalize, tax compliance could come into play: MVP assumes most users are below VAT thresholds and won't need VAT filings. If needed, we'll incorporate tax calculations in future. We also assume that using this platform does not conflict with any local regulations – in fact it should help formalization. POPIA compliance is a must (consent for data, right to be forgotten if a user leaves, etc.), which we are building in as noted.
* **Data Accuracy:** We assume users will input data accurately (garbage-in-garbage-out risk). If a user doesn't record all sales or stock changes, the insights suffer. We mitigate this by making entry easy and showing them the value of complete data (like if they keep stock updated, they get useful alerts). But a constraint is that we cannot force behavior – adoption will vary. The system will be designed to be forgiving (e.g., allow them to adjust stock or back-date entries if they forget).

**Technical Constraints:**

* **Resource Limitations:** Being an MVP, we have limited development time and budget. Therefore, we might use some existing open-source modules or services (like an open-source chatbot framework, or ERPNext's code for certain calculations if license permits) to speed up development. We also might not have the capacity to build highly sophisticated AI in-house initially – thus our AI features will use relatively straightforward models or third-party APIs (like using a pre-built forecasting API if available).
* **Integration Limitations:** While we plan for various integrations (payments, logistics), as a constraint we need to choose specific providers for MVP due to time. For example, we might integrate only one payment gateway at first (say PayFast or Snapscan). This might not cover all user preferences but is a starting point. Similarly, we might only integrate SMS and hold off on WhatsApp API if that's too complex initially, using SMS as a fallback for notifications.
* **Compatibility:** The system is primarily for modern web and Android. We assume iPhone users are few in this segment (though some might exist), but Flutter allows iOS build if needed. On web, we assume modern browsers; we likely won't support IE11, but any Chrome/Firefox on even older PCs should work. If a user has only a very old feature phone (non-smartphone), they can't use the app – that is a constraint (one that TREP might address by encouraging smartphone uptake).

**Environmental Constraints:**

* **Power and Infrastructure:** In rural areas, electricity might be unreliable (e.g., South Africa's load shedding). This means users might not charge phones or might be offline for stretches. Our offline design addresses some of this, but it's a reality: if their device is off or network down, real-time collaboration is delayed. We assume these conditions but design for eventual recovery of sync.
* **Language & Localization:** MVP will be in English (maybe with an option to switch to another language later). This is a constraint due to development time – even though many users speak local languages (Zulu, Xhosa, etc.), providing full localization in MVP might not be feasible. We mitigate by using simple English and possibly including a few common terms in multiple languages (like on a welcome screen or so). Later, we definitely want to localize.

**Future-proofing vs Now:** We assume that proving value in MVP is more important than solving every long-term scenario. So some constraints we accept now (like limited multi-user support, single language, one country focus) knowing we plan to address them in later phases (see Roadmap). The architecture however is built to extend – e.g., multi-tenant support is there, so adding new regions or languages won't require redesign.

In conclusion, our assumptions ensure that we tailor the MVP to the reality of our end users (connectivity, literacy, willingness) and our constraints keep the project achievable in scope. Recognizing these upfront helps align stakeholder expectations – for example, executives should know that while the vision is grand (ERP III platform), the MVP will start small and focused, given the constraints of development and user context. We will validate many of these assumptions in pilot (like: do users actually use the AI suggestions? Are they comfortable joining group orders?), and be ready to adjust the product based on real-world feedback.

## 8. Roadmap and Future Scope

The MVP is just the beginning. We envision TOSS evolving into a comprehensive **ERP III platform** that continually adds value for informal businesses and perhaps expands to formal SMEs as well. Below is a high-level roadmap outlining immediate post-MVP improvements and longer-term features, as well as the future scope that goes beyond the MVP.

**Near-Term Roadmap (Next 6-12 months after MVP launch):**

1. **Pilot Feedback and Iteration (Month 1-3 post-launch):** Conduct a pilot with a select group of TREP businesses. Gather feedback on usability, identify any critical missing features or bugs, and iterate quickly. For example, users might request an easier way to input bulk inventory or a report printout. **Success metrics from MVP (collaboration usage, sales growth)** will be evaluated and used to adjust features. We may discover, for instance, that users heavily use group purchasing for certain goods but need more facilitation – prompting us to add features like group chat for purchase groups or a way to handle payments in-app.

2. **Enhanced Collaboration Tools (Month 3-6):**

   * Implement more **structured group buying** support: e.g., integrate directly with a wholesaler's system or allow an "aggregator" role (maybe a cooperative manager) to coordinate orders. We might add dynamic pricing calculations (showing potential discount as group grows) or more automation like splitting delivery costs.
   * Add a **reputation or rating system** in the peer network: users can rate suppliers or partners after transactions. This builds trust over time, crucial as the network grows.
   * Introduce **cooperative features** for group-owned entities: If a group of users form a buying cooperative or shared resource entity, the system could treat it as a special type of user with multiple owners. This might involve multi-user access and profit-sharing records.

3. **AI & Analytics Improvements (Month 3-6):**

   * **Refine AI models** with more data. As transactions accumulate, we can train better forecasting models. Possibly incorporate external data like public holidays or weather (if it affects sales).
   * Expand **insights library**: e.g., comparative insights ("Your sales are in the top 10% of similar shops in your area" – using anonymized peer data, if privacy allows).
   * Add OCR capabilities to the mobile app: Let users scan receipts or bills (e.g., from wholesaler purchases) and automatically input them into expenses/inventory. This leverages AI for convenience and accuracy.
   * Evolve the chatbot to handle more complex queries and support **local languages**. For example, allow users to ask questions in Zulu or Sesotho and get responses (either by integrating a translation layer or training multilingual intents).

4. **Additional ERP Modules (Month 6-12):** Based on user demand, gradually introduce new modules:

   * **Purchasing Module** (if not fully in MVP): a more detailed procurement workflow including supplier quotes, purchase orders, and linking with accounts payable. This ties well with group buying (a group buy could generate individual POs for participants).
   * **HR/Payroll Lite:** For slightly larger small businesses that have employees, provide a way to track employee info, their salaries, and automate payroll calculations on a basic level. Even informal businesses have casual employees – a simple timesheet or salary log might be useful. We'd ensure compliance with labor laws if we go deeper, but initial scope is tracking and expense integration.
   * **CRM & Marketing:** Expand CRM to allow capturing leads, recording customer preferences, maybe a loyalty program tracker. Integration with messaging could allow marketing blasts (with consent). This helps businesses grow customer retention.
   * **Multi-language Support:** Internationalize the app interface so it can be translated. Focus on major South African languages for UI text. This will greatly help adoption in rural areas where English proficiency is low.

5. **Platform Scalability and Stability (Ongoing):** As user count grows, invest in performance tuning. Possibly move some services to dedicated instances or optimize the database (indexing, partitioning for multi-tenant). Implement more sophisticated monitoring, and maybe a support dashboard for TREP administrators to assist users (like seeing if a user hasn't synced in a while and might need help).

**Long-Term Vision (Beyond 1 year):**

* **Integration with Financial Services:** One of the bigger future opportunities is to leverage the data in TOSS to help businesses access finance. For example:

  * **Credit Scoring & Loans:** By tracking sales and cash flow, TOSS can generate a financial profile for each business – effectively a digital credit profile. With user consent, this could be shared with banks or microfinance institutions to **facilitate access to working capital loans or credit lines**. The platform could even integrate loan offers and repayment tracking directly. E.g., after 6 months of usage, a shop might qualify for a small loan which they can apply for through TOSS.
  * **Insurance Products:** Similarly, data can help insurers offer tailored products (like stock insurance or income protection) to these businesses. Future integration could bring insurance enrollment inside the app.
  * **Payments Expansion:** Add support for more payment types (integrate e-wallets popular in Africa, support cash-in/out records) and possibly enable **customer-facing features** like sending an invoice link to a customer to pay online.

* **E-commerce and Marketplace:** Expand TOSS to allow businesses to **sell online**. This could mean a feature where a business can push their products to a simple online storefront or a common marketplace app for township businesses. Customers could browse and order for pickup or delivery. We could integrate with delivery services to make this viable. Essentially, empower micro-enterprises to reach customers via digital channels, not just physical. ERPNext has a website/e-commerce module; a similar concept can be adapted for our context (maybe lighter weight and mobile-centric). For example, a cooperative marketplace app where local consumers can see all TREP businesses' offerings and buy directly.

* **Advanced Inventory and Supply Chain:** Introduce more sophisticated inventory features if needed, like **inventory optimization** (beyond reordering rules, use AI to maintain optimal stock levels), **warehouse management** for those who grow (maybe small distribution centers for co-ops), and even integration with upstream suppliers (automated ordering from wholesalers as soon as group order forms, etc.). We could also incorporate **IoT** in the future – e.g., smart sensors for storage (fridge temperature monitors, etc.) feeding into the platform for maintenance alerts or quality control (fits in Industry 4.0 concepts, though maybe far-future for informal sector).

* **Manufacturing/Production Module:** If some users are small manufacturers (e.g., someone making soap or furniture under TREP), we might introduce a production planning module. That could include simple **Bill of Materials and Work Orders** like ERPNext's manufacturing. This would help any business that makes products (tailors, bakeries, etc.) to plan their raw material usage and production schedule.

* **Project and Job Management:** For service-oriented users (mechanics, repair services, etc.), a project/job module could help track jobs, assign tasks to workers, and schedule work. E.g., a mechanic could have a board of ongoing repair jobs, track time/cost, and then bill upon completion.

* **Geographical Expansion:** Once proven in South Africa, TOSS could be expanded to other countries/markets with similar informal economy dynamics. The architecture supports multi-tenancy, so spinning up for another country might involve localization (currency, language, local integrations). For instance, expansion into other African countries (Nigeria, Kenya, etc.) where informal SMEs are plenty. But this will require integration with their local payment systems and compliance with their data laws.

* **AI Evolution:** Continually make the platform "smarter". Potential future AI features:

  * **Personalized Coaching:** The system could act like a business coach, proactively analyzing the business performance and messaging the owner tips ("Your profit margin is low this month; consider raising prices by 5% on these items").
  * **Chatbot commerce:** The chatbot could eventually interface with suppliers too – e.g., a user says "Order 20 loaves of bread for tomorrow" to the chatbot, and the system automatically places the order with a linked bakery.
  * **Voice Interface:** Considering some users might be more comfortable speaking than typing (and if literacy is an issue), we might implement voice input for recording transactions or asking the chatbot questions (in local language too). This could be transformative for very low-literacy users.

* **DevOps and Ecosystem:** In the future, we might open up parts of the platform via APIs to external developers or partners (creating an ecosystem of add-ons specialized for certain sectors). For example, a third-party could integrate a wage subsidy program or a farm produce marketplace into TOSS. This post-modern ERP idea (like modular, pluggable additions) could make TOSS a central platform for township entrepreneurs. Technically, we'd need to expose secure APIs or have an app marketplace.

* **Governance and Social Impact:** Work with government to use aggregated (and anonymized) data from TOSS to inform policy. For example, showing the economic activity of townships, inventory supply gaps, etc. This is outside the product features but is a value-add in the bigger picture. Also, future versions might incorporate compliance features to help businesses transition to formal (tax filing plugins, business registration help, etc., maybe in partnership with SARS or CIPC in South Africa).

**Roadmap Visualization:** We could break it into phases:

* **Phase 1:** MVP launch (Q4 2025) – Core ERP + AI + Collab basics for TREP sectors.
* **Phase 2:** (2026) – Pilot improvements, add Purchasing, multi-language, enhanced group buys, initial financial integration (maybe one pilot credit program).
* **Phase 3:** (2026-2027) – New modules like HR, e-commerce storefront, heavy AI analytics, more countries.
* **Phase 4:** (2027+) – Fully mature ERP III platform, possibly integrate blockchain for supply chain transparency if ever needed, or become the de-facto operating system for informal businesses in multiple regions.

We will maintain a **product backlog** of features and prioritize based on user feedback and strategic goals (like increasing collaboration usage or monetization opportunities through integrations).

The **future scope** of TOSS is vast: it can grow from assisting individual micro-entrepreneurs to **building a connected economy** of small businesses. In that future, a shop owner using TOSS might seamlessly source all inventory, access finance, sell online, and manage staff – all in one platform. Our incremental approach ensures we deliver tangible value at each step without overwhelming users or the development team.

To conclude, this PRD outlines the foundational vision and requirements for the TOSS MVP. By successfully launching the MVP and following the roadmap, we aim to transform how informal businesses operate – driving growth, efficiency, and collaboration in South Africa's township and rural economies, and eventually, similar economies worldwide. Each feature and design choice for MVP has been made with scalability and the end-user's empowerment in mind, setting the stage for TOSS to become a cornerstone of the ERP III era in emerging markets.
