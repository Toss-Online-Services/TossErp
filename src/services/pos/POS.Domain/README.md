# POS Domain Layer

This project contains the domain layer for the Point of Sale (POS) system, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and Clean Architecture patterns.

## Key Concepts

### Aggregates
- Aggregate roots define consistency boundaries
- Each aggregate is a cluster of domain objects treated as a unit
- Aggregates maintain invariants and enforce business rules

### Domain Events
- Used for cross-boundary communication
- Represent something that happened in the domain
- Implemented using MediatR

### Value Objects
- Immutable objects that describe aspects of the domain
- No identity, defined by their attributes
- Used for concepts like Money, Address, etc.

### Domain Services
- Operations that don't naturally fit within an entity
- Stateless operations that work with multiple aggregates
- Implement complex business rules

### Specifications
- Encapsulate complex queries
- Reusable query logic
- Can be combined to create complex queries

## Best Practices

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Keep domain logic within entities
   - Use private setters and methods
   - Expose behavior through public methods

2. **Validation**
   - Validate at the domain level
   - Use value objects for validation
   - Throw domain exceptions for invalid states

3. **Persistence**
   - Use repository interfaces
   - Keep persistence concerns out of domain
   - Use specifications for queries

4. **Testing**
   - Unit test domain logic
   - Test aggregate invariants
   - Test domain events

## Dependencies

- MediatR: For domain events
- System.Reflection.TypeExtensions: For reflection utilities
