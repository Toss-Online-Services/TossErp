# TOSS Platform Functional Specification v1.0

## Introduction

**TOSS (The One-Stop Solution)** is a next-generation ERP-III platform tailored for South African township and rural businesses. It combines a full suite of ERP modules with intelligent _Service-as-Software (SaaS 2.0)_ features and a _Collaborative Network_ layer to help small businesses not just manage operations, but also gain insights and work together as a community[\[1\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L52-L60)[\[2\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L118-L126). The system is **offline-first and mobile-first**, delivered as a Nuxt 4 Progressive Web App for low-end Android devices, and powered by a multi-tenant, event-driven .NET 8 backend (Clean Architecture with PostgreSQL)[\[3\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L263-L271)[\[4\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L243-L250). Every design choice aligns with ERPNext's proven ERP module concepts[\[5\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L158-L166), adapted to be simpler and more context-appropriate for users like spaza shop owners, hawkers, small-scale manufacturers, and other township entrepreneurs.

**Product Pillars:** The platform consists of three integrated layers[\[6\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L90-L98):

- **ERP-III Modules (Business Backbone):** Traditional ERP domains (Sales, Purchasing, Accounting, Stock, etc.) providing the essential tools to run a business.
- **SaaS 2.0 (AI Business Coach):** An AI-driven layer that watches business data and proactively suggests actions or automations (a "business manager with an MBA" guiding the owner)[\[7\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L110-L118).
- **Collaborative Network:** Multi-tenant capabilities that let independent businesses cooperate - pooling orders, sharing resources, and collectively negotiating as a network[\[8\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L120-L124).

In the sections below, each ERP module is specified in detail - including its purpose, key workflows, business rules, data model, UI/UX expectations (with offline functionality), and an example use case in a township/rural context. Subsequent sections describe how the AI SaaS layer and Collaborative Network layer augment these modules with insights and cross-organization workflows. All functionality is aligned with ERPNext's documented features for familiarity and robustness[\[9\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L160-L169)[\[10\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L176-L183), while ensuring the solution remains **simple, offline-capable, and intuitive** for the target users[\[11\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L54-L61).

## Selling (Sales & Marketing Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Selling module streamlines the entire sales process from first customer contact to final sale, while also helping manage customer relationships. It covers customer inquiries, quotations, sales orders, deliveries, and invoicing, integrating closely with CRM and Accounting. In essence, this module helps businesses **generate and track sales** and maintain customer info to improve service and revenue[\[12\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=The%20Selling%20module%20in%20ERPNext,and%20enhance%20customer%20relationship%20management)[\[13\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=The%20CRM%20module%20in%20ERPNext,interactions%20and%20streamline%20sales%20processes). It also supports basic marketing functions like tracking campaigns or referrals relevant to township businesses (e.g. word-of-mouth promotions).

**Core Workflows:** Key workflows in Selling include:

- **Lead-to-Quote:** Capture a lead or inquiry (via CRM), then create a **Quotation** (sales quote) for the products/services the customer is interested in. Quotations can be emailed or WhatsApped to customers and later converted to orders[\[14\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=,on%20sales%20performance%2C%20revenue%2C%20and).
- **Order Fulfillment:** Convert an accepted quotation into a **Sales Order**. The Sales Order is the confirmed customer order, which initiates reservation of stock. From the Sales Order, generate a **Delivery Note** (packing/delivery slip) to ship goods, and finally create a **Sales Invoice** to bill the customer[\[14\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=,on%20sales%20performance%2C%20revenue%2C%20and).
- **Direct Sale (POS):** For walk-in or counter sales, use the POS interface (integrated with this module) to quickly create an invoice and record payment on the spot (see **POS module** below for details). POS sales automatically deduct stock and create accounting entries.
- **Returns & Credit Notes:** If a customer returns an item, record a **Sales Return** (Credit Note) which updates stock and creates a credit in the customer's account.
- **Payment Collection:** Track payments against sales invoices (handled in Accounting module but visible in customer account status). Manage accounts receivable and follow up on overdue payments if any.
- **Customer Management:** Maintain a master list of **Customers** with contact info, billing/shipping addresses, and credit terms. This links to CRM for communication history and to Accounting for credit limits and outstanding balances[\[15\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=,trends%20to%20inform%20strategic%20decisions).

**Business Rules & Validation:** Several business rules ensure data integrity and proper sales cycles:

- **Quotation Validity:** Quotations have an expiration date; the system prevents converting an expired quote to an order without extension.
- **Stock Reservation:** Confirmation of a Sales Order will reserve stock (or trigger a backorder if stock is insufficient). The system will not allow delivery notes to be submitted for quantities beyond what's in stock or reserved (unless configured to allow negative stock in special cases).
- **Pricing Rules:** The module should support promotional pricing or volume discounts (e.g. buy-one-get-one or bulk price breaks) via a pricing rule engine. When an item is added to a sales order or invoice, applicable price rules are applied automatically[\[16\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=What%20features%20are%20available%20in,the%20Sales%20module).
- **Status Transitions:** Documents follow defined status flows - e.g. Sales Order statuses: Draft → Submitted/Confirmed → Completed (when fully delivered and invoiced) or Cancelled. Delivery Notes cannot be submitted if there is no linked order (configurable) or if required stock is not available. Invoices require an associated Sales Order/Delivery or can be standalone for direct sales.
- **Credit Control:** If a customer has exceeded their credit limit or has overdue invoices, the system can warn or block new sales orders to that customer (based on configuration). This protects businesses from extending too much informal credit.
- **Taxes and Discounts:** Sales transactions calculate taxes (VAT, etc.) as defined. The system validates that required tax fields are filled and calculations are correct. Similarly, if any line or global discounts are given, they must respect configured limits (e.g. an owner might set a max 10% discount for sales staff).

**Data Model & Key Fields:** Important DocTypes (data entities) in the Selling module:

- **Customer:** Stores customer details (name, contact info, customer type, credit limit, price list, etc.).
- **Quotation:** Key fields - customer, validity date, item lines (item, quantity, rate, amount), totals, and status. Quotation can reference a **Lead** (from CRM) before a customer is formally created.
- **Sales Order:** Key fields - customer, order date, required delivery date, item lines (with quantities and rates), taxes/charges, and a status (e.g. Draft/Submitted/Completed). Also flags like _"Is POS?"_ or _"Delivery Required"_.
- **Delivery Note:** Key fields - linked sales order, date, items (with actual delivered quantities, batch/serial numbers if applicable), delivery address, and status. Updates stock ledger when submitted.
- **Sales Invoice:** Key fields - customer, posting date, items (similar to order), taxes, payment terms, and status (Unpaid/Paid/Overdue). Invoice posts accounting entries (debit customer, credit income & tax).
- **Item:** (shared with Stock module) includes selling-related fields like selling rate, default sales UoM, and whether it can be sold.
- **Pricing Rule:** Defines conditions for discounts or special pricing (e.g. 5% off if quantity > 10 or for a certain customer group).
- **Campaign/Referral:** (If used) Could log marketing campaigns or referral programs tied to sales (to track lead sources, etc.).

**User Interface & Experience:** The Selling module is accessible through a dashboard and form views that are optimized for mobile. A sales user (or shop owner) can easily search and select items when making a quotation or order, with quick filters (by item group or by typing part of the name). The UI uses clear language - e.g., "New Sale" instead of "Sales Order" if targeting less tech-savvy users[\[17\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L80-L88)[\[18\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L294-L301). On mobile, forms are broken into collapsible sections or steps to avoid overwhelming the screen. For example, when creating a Sales Order on a phone, Step 1 could capture customer info (with an option to quickly add a new customer), Step 2 selects items (with a touch-friendly list of items and a search bar), and Step 3 confirms totals and tax. The module also provides a **Sales Dashboard** with key metrics like total sales this week, top-selling items, and outstanding receivables in a simple card format. Graphs or charts (e.g. a monthly sales trend) are shown as tappable images or sparklines for quick insight.

**Offline Capabilities:** Most **Selling** transactions can be initiated offline if needed. Specifically, the POS sub-module is built to work offline (see POS section), which covers a large portion of sales in a retail context. For other sales scenarios (like making a quotation or order for a bulk sale), offline use is less common but still supported: the app would allow creating a Quotation or Sales Order offline and mark it as "Pending Sync." The record would sync to the server when connectivity is restored, at which point any stock reservation or workflow actions are finalized. The system ensures no duplicate order numbers are issued by using a local temp ID that is reconciled on sync. While offline, the user will still be able to search for items and customers if those were cached - hence, the app caches the item catalog and recent customer list locally. Any price lists or tax templates should also be cached so that quotations/orders computed offline have correct pricing. **Note:** The Selling module's offline support is critical mainly for POS; for order management, it is a convenience that allows, say, a salesperson taking an order in the field without network to record it and sync later.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Naledi runs a small hardware store in a township. Using the Selling module, she records both over-the-counter sales and bulk orders from local contractors. For a walk-in customer buying a hammer and nails, she uses the POS interface on her tablet - even if her internet is down, the sale is recorded and a receipt is printed. Later, a local builder calls to inquire about cement prices. Naledi creates a_ _Quotation_ _in the system (on her phone) and sends it via WhatsApp. The builder accepts the quote, so she converts it to a_ _Sales Order_ _and schedules delivery. The system reserves the 100 bags of cement in inventory. When her driver delivers the goods, Naledi generates a_ _Delivery Note_ _from the app and captures the customer's signature. Finally, she issues a_ _Sales Invoice. All along, the system has been updating stock levels and accounting entries. That evening, TOSS's AI assistant sends Naledi a quick insight: "You sold 90% of your cement stock today - consider reordering soon."_

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** The Selling module is enhanced by AI-driven features that act as a smart sales assistant. For example, the system can analyze past sales and customer behavior to suggest **"next best offers"** - if a customer frequently buys item A and B, the system might prompt the seller during quotation or checkout: "Customers who bought A often need C as well." It can also monitor sales trends and alert the business owner with friendly messages, like: "Sales are slower this week than last - consider a weekend promotion." The AI can automatically identify the **top customers** by revenue and prompt the owner to send them a thank-you message or a loyalty reward. It will watch pricing and margins too - if a salesperson tries to give a discount that pushes an item's margin below a threshold, the system can warn or require approval (or later notify the owner: "Discount on Order #123 was high, margin only 5%[\[19\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L234-L241)."). These insights and actions are integrated seamlessly into workflows (e.g., a pop-up suggestion in the order screen, or a daily sales summary via the dashboard). The goal is to augment the seller's decision-making, especially for users who may not have formal sales analysis training.

**Collaborative Network Features:** On the collaboration front, the Selling module enables township businesses to leverage group marketing and shared sales opportunities. For instance, **Referral Programs** could be network-wide: multiple spaza shops might participate in a referral scheme where customers referring new shoppers get a reward, and this is tracked across the network (e.g., if a customer refers someone to any shop in the network, all share the referral data). The module can also support **"group sales"** - for example, if a supplier offers a bulk deal that no single shop could afford, the system could allow a group of shops to collectively sell a bundle. Each shop would get a portion to sell, and the system monitors the overall campaign. Another collaborative scenario: shops sharing inventory info - a customer at Shop A wants an item that's out of stock there, the salesperson can check TOSS to see if a nearby Shop B (who agreed to data sharing) has it, then either redirect the customer or facilitate a transfer. The Selling module, tied with the Stock module, would handle the documentation of that transfer as an inter-company sale/purchase with minimal friction. All such collaborative sales activities respect permissions - businesses opt in to share certain data (like item availability) with trusted partners or the wider network.

## Buying (Procurement Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Buying module manages the procurement process end-to-end, helping businesses efficiently purchase goods and services and maintain healthy supplier relationships. It covers everything from requesting supplier quotes, placing purchase orders, receiving goods into stock, to handling supplier invoices. In essence, this module ensures that **stock is replenished** in a timely, controlled manner and that **purchases are tracked and optimized** for cost and quality[\[20\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=The%20Buying%20module%20in%20ERPNext,processes%20and%20optimise%20supplier%20relationships)[\[21\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=,levels%20and%20manage%20stock%20replenishment). For small businesses, this means simplifying tasks like reordering inventory and keeping tabs on what they owe suppliers.

**Core Workflows:** Key workflows in Buying include:

- **Material Request (Requisition):** Optionally, a department or shop can create a **Material Request** (indicating needed items and quantities). This is an internal document signaling procurement needs (e.g., a shop owner notes they need 50 units of product X). Material Requests can be consolidated or approved before ordering.
- **Request for Quotation (RFQ):** The system can generate RFQs to send to multiple suppliers for pricing, especially for new items or bulk buys[\[20\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=The%20Buying%20module%20in%20ERPNext,processes%20and%20optimise%20supplier%20relationships). Suppliers' quotes can be recorded for comparison.
- **Supplier Quotation:** Record any quotes received from suppliers (price lists, terms). This helps in selecting the best supplier for an order. For recurring items, the last purchase rate is auto-suggested or supplier price lists can be maintained.
- **Purchase Order (PO):** Create a **Purchase Order** to a chosen supplier for required items and quantities[\[22\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=,levels%20and%20manage%20stock%20replenishment). The PO outlines what is being purchased, at what price, and expected delivery date. POs can be directly made (if the supplier and item prices are known) or after RFQ/quotation process. Once a PO is submitted (confirmed), it often reserves budget and awaits receipt.
- **Purchase Receipt (Goods Receipt):** When ordered items arrive, record a **Purchase Receipt** (sometimes called Goods Received Note). Here the actual quantities received (which might be partial or have some discrepancy) are recorded, and stock levels are increased accordingly. Quality inspections may be triggered here (integration with Quality module if an item requires QC on receipt).
- **Purchase Invoice (Supplier Invoice):** Record the supplier's bill by creating a **Purchase Invoice**. This can be done upon receipt or later. The purchase invoice will reference the PO and/or receipt, include pricing, taxes, and any shipping or additional charges. Submitting a purchase invoice posts to accounting (accounts payable) and can update stock valuation.
- **Payments to Supplier:** Although handled in Accounting, the Buying module ties into tracking when and how supplier payments are made (either against the purchase invoice or as advance payments).
- **Stock Replenishment Workflow:** The module supports reordering rules - e.g., if stock for an item falls below a threshold, it can auto-generate a Material Request or even a draft Purchase Order for approval[\[23\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=The%20Stock%20or%20Inventory%20module,in%20ERPNext%20helps%20you%20to). This ties into the AI as well for suggestions.

**Business Rules & Validation:** Procurement must enforce certain rules:

- **Supplier Selection:** Only approved (active) suppliers can be used on POs. The system may enforce that for certain items, purchase must be from specific suppliers (if configured). If multiple quotes exist, selection should be justified (system can log which quotation was chosen for transparency).
- **PO Approval:** For larger orders or group buys, an approval step can be required (e.g., if order value > X, require manager approval). This can be configured via workflow.
- **Three-Way Matching:** The system supports matching PO -> Receipt -> Invoice. It validates that the quantities and prices on the purchase invoice do not exceed what was ordered and received beyond a tolerance. If a supplier invoice comes in with a higher rate or extra item, the system flags it for review. Likewise, if the received quantity is more than ordered, system either prevents over-receipt or logs it as excess (which could be returned or accepted as extra, depending on settings).
- **Stock Update:** A Purchase Receipt cannot be submitted if it would drive stock negative for returns or if mandatory batch/serial info is missing for items that require it. Submission of receipts and cancellations must update the stock ledger and **Stock module** accordingly in an atomic, consistent way.
- **Status Transitions:** PO statuses: Draft → Submitted (order placed) → Partially Received (if some items or partial quantities received) → Completed (fully received and invoiced) or Closed/Cancelled. Similar for Material Requests (open, approved, fulfilled) and others. The system automatically updates status (e.g., mark PO as "Completed" when linked receipts cover all quantities, and invoice is done).
- **Supplier Management:** The module maintains **Supplier** master records with contact info, payment terms, default currency, etc.[\[22\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=,levels%20and%20manage%20stock%20replenishment). It also can track a supplier's performance (like on-time delivery, quality issues) to inform future purchasing - this is more advanced, but even a simple rating or notes field is provided. Business rules could include blocking POs to blacklisted suppliers or warning if a supplier has pending issues.
- **Budget Control:** (If Accounting budgets are used) - warn or block if a purchase will cause an expense budget to exceed limits, relevant if the business sets spending budgets.

**Data Model & Key Fields:** Main DocTypes in Buying:

- **Supplier:** Stores supplier info (name, supplier type, default currency, credit terms, etc.). Also holds their bank details if needed for payments.
- **Material Request:** Key fields - requested items (with quantities), purpose (purchase vs internal transfer), required by date, and status. May include who requested it.
- **Supplier Quotation:** Key fields - supplier, items with quoted rates, validity. Often created from RFQ or entered manually.
- **Purchase Order:** Key fields - supplier, order date, expected delivery date, item table (item code, quantity, rate, amount, tax category), terms (like payment terms or incoterm), and status. Also links to project or cost center if purchases are for a specific project or department (for cost tracking).
- **Purchase Receipt:** Key fields - supplier, receiving date, reference PO, item table (received qty, rejected qty if any, batch/serial details), warehouse where stock is received, and status. Includes a checkbox if this receipt is to update stock (in some cases a "non-stock receipt" might be allowed for services, which doesn't affect stock).
- **Purchase Invoice:** Key fields - supplier, posting date, due date, item/services with amounts, taxes and charges (like VAT), and link to PO/receipt. Also includes bill reference number (supplier's invoice no.) for record. Payment status (Unpaid/Paid).
- **Item:** (from Stock module) has purchasing details like default supplier, last purchase rate, purchase UoM, etc.
- **Warehouse:** (from Stock) - needed when receiving items to stock.

Additionally, **Price List** and **Currency** are used if multi-currency purchasing is allowed (e.g., a shop might buy from an overseas supplier). The system should handle such, but township use likely local suppliers with local currency.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Buying module's UI is oriented towards simplicity - many small businesses don't have dedicated procurement officers, so the shop owner or manager will typically handle purchasing. The module provides a **"Reorder Items"** view or report that lists all items low in stock (with current level and suggested reorder qty) for quick action. With one tap, the user could add selected items to a new Purchase Order draft, making the reordering process very straightforward (especially on mobile). When creating a Purchase Order, the UI lets the user choose a supplier and then add items. On mobile, selecting items might be from a drop-down or a multi-select list of items that need restocking. The app might also allow scanning a product barcode to add it to the order (useful if reordering by scanning empty shelf items). Each item line can show last purchase price as a reference. The interface uses clear terms - e.g., "Buy from Supplier" for the PO form, "Goods Received" for the receipt form - instead of jargon.

For group buying scenarios, the UI might show a tag if an item can be bought as part of a group order (see Collaborative section). The Purchase Order list view highlights status (e.g., a partially received PO might show a progress bar of received vs ordered). **Notifications:** If any PO is overdue (expected date passed with no receipt), the system flags it and can notify the user ("Your order from Supplier X is overdue for 2 days").

Mobile offline behavior: while purchasing usually requires being online to communicate with suppliers, the app will allow creation of POs offline if needed (e.g., fill out what you need to buy in the field, sync later to actually send or export). However, critical functions like sending an RFQ email obviously need connectivity - the system will queue the email to send when back online.

**Offline Capabilities:** The Buying module benefits from offline mode primarily in terms of data access and drafting transactions. For instance, if a user is in a warehouse with no signal and doing a stock review, they might create a Material Request offline as they notice low items. The app will save it locally and sync it to the server when back online. The **item catalogue and supplier info** are cached so that even offline, the user can select items and suppliers on a PO. When network is available, the PO can be finalized and sent. Additionally, if multiple shops are on the platform under one tenant, a store manager might be offline but still record receipt of delivered goods - the Purchase Receipt can be made offline (so inventory on that device is updated locally) and then it syncs to update central stock when online. The system ensures that once synced, any pending accounting for receipts/invoices are posted properly. In case of conflicts (e.g., two offline users both try to receive the same PO), the server will reconcile by first-come-first-serve and notify if any duplicate or overlap happened.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Lerato owns a small spaza and needs to restock popular items like flour, sugar, and cold drinks. She checks her TOSS app's_ _Reorder Suggestions, which (based on low stock thresholds and recent sales) lists items to replenish. With one tap, she generates a_ _Purchase Order_ _for those items from her usual wholesaler. She's offline at the moment (no data coverage in the storeroom), but the app still lets her create the order. Later, when she gets connectivity, the PO syncs and she sends it out via email/WhatsApp to the supplier. A couple of days later, the supplier's truck arrives. Lerato opens the original PO on her phone and converts it to a_ _Purchase Receipt_ _by ticking off the items that were delivered. One item (sugar) comes short - she ordered 20 bags but only 15 arrived. She notes that in the receipt (the system will keep the PO open for the remaining 5). Instantly, her stock levels for sugar increase by 15 in the system_[_\[24\]_](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=,levels%20and%20manage%20stock%20replenishment)_. The next day, the supplier sends her an invoice for the delivered goods. She enters it as a_ _Purchase Invoice_ _in TOSS, which now shows she owes the supplier R5,000 payable in 30 days. The_ _AI assistant_ _in TOSS observes that multiple shops in her area also frequently reorder sugar around the same time; it suggests a_ _group buying opportunity_ _(covered later) so they could negotiate a bulk discount. It also notes the partial delivery and reminds Lerato to follow up on the 5 pending bags or adjust the order._

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Decision Support):** The Buying module is significantly enhanced by TOSS's intelligent layer. The AI monitors consumption rates and can generate **automated reorder suggestions**[\[25\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L222-L225)[\[26\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L500-L508). For example, it will learn seasonal patterns (e.g., cold drink sales spike in summer) and preemptively suggest higher reorder quantities ahead of time. It also keeps track of supplier performance - if a certain supplier's deliveries are often late or short, the system might alert the user or suggest an alternative supplier. When creating a Purchase Order, if similar businesses in the network are also looking to buy the same item, the AI might prompt: "3 other nearby shops also need sugar - consider a group purchase to save on costs." For cost control, the AI flags anomalies like "The price for flour in this PO is 10% higher than your last purchase[\[27\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L110-L115)" (prompting the user to possibly negotiate or check another supplier). The SaaS layer can also provide cash flow insight: before a user places a large order, it might warn if the bank balance is low or if many bills are due soon ("Reminder: You have R8,000 of supplier payments due next week[\[28\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L114-L117)"). These insights are delivered in a helpful tone, often via the module's UI (e.g., a warning icon next to a supplier name if there's a known issue, or a pop-up suggestion) and via summary notifications. Essentially, the AI acts as a purchasing advisor, helping small business owners make smarter buying decisions without needing a formal procurement department.

**Collaborative Network Features:** The Buying module opens up one of the most powerful collaborative features of TOSS: **Group Buying**. In a network of small businesses, TOSS can coordinate combined purchase orders. For example, ten spaza shops can aggregate their needs and place one large order to a wholesaler for bulk pricing. The system supports this by allowing a **"Multi-tenant Purchase Order"** or a mechanism where each shop creates a PO which the system then merges or links into a single **Group Order** for the supplier. The Collaborative layer manages permissions and data sharing: each participant sees the items and quantities they contributed, and perhaps the overall total, but not the others' sensitive info beyond what's necessary (like they might see "5 other shops are participating, total combined order = 100 units"). When the goods arrive, TOSS helps split the bulk delivery - generating individual Purchase Receipts for each shop's portion, while the primary receiver (maybe a hub) logs the main receipt. Financially, the system can either split the supplier invoice for each participant or record one invoice to a "group account" and track settlements from each shop. This requires trust, so the platform likely involves a **central facilitator** (could be a cooperative head or a nominated lead shop) who manages the transaction with the supplier. TOSS handles the communication: sending out a notice to the network "Opportunity: Bulk sugar at 10% off if 500kg total order. Pledge your quantity by Friday.", then consolidating responses.

Another collaborative aspect is **Vendor Management** in a shared sense. The module could allow sharing supplier ratings or experiences across the network (with consent). For instance, if one shop had issues with a supplier's product quality, they could flag it, and other shops see that note (like a community-driven supplier scorecard[\[29\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L426-L434)). Conversely, positive experiences or negotiation wins can be shared ("Supplier X gave us 5% off on bulk rice - mention that when you order"). The Buying module, through events, can also coordinate **shared logistics**: multiple shops can indicate they want to pick up from the supplier's depot, so the system triggers a combined pickup plan (in conjunction with the Logistics/Supply Chain module). All these scenarios require event-driven communication and permissioned data sharing, which the Collaborative Network layer provides (detailed later). In summary, the Buying module is not just about one business purchasing, but enabling many small buyers to act collectively as a bigger buyer for better pricing and efficiency[\[30\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L274-L282).

## CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

**Overview & Purpose:** The CRM module focuses on managing leads, customer interactions, and sales opportunities, serving as the pre-sales and client relationship hub that feeds into the Selling module. It enables businesses to **capture leads, follow up proactively, and nurture customer relationships** in an organized way[\[13\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=The%20CRM%20module%20in%20ERPNext,interactions%20and%20streamline%20sales%20processes). For township and rural businesses, CRM might include keeping track of regular customers' preferences, managing informal customer credit, and simple loyalty mechanisms. The goal is to enhance customer service and not let any sales opportunity slip through the cracks.

**Core Workflows:** Key processes in CRM include:

- **Lead Management:** Record new **Leads** (potential customers or inquiries). A lead entry typically includes name, contact info, how they heard about the business, and what they're interested in. For example, a walk-in who asks for a product currently out of stock can be noted as a lead to call back when stock arrives. Leads can be captured via an online form (if using the website), via WhatsApp inquiries, or manually by staff[\[31\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=,to%20ensure%20effective%20customer%20engagement).
- **Lead Nurturing & Communication:** Schedule follow-ups for leads. The system can create **To-Do** or **Events** (calls/meetings) linked to leads - e.g., "Call John next Monday about catering quote." Keep a log of communications (calls made, emails sent, meetings). If the business uses integrated messaging (email/SMS/WhatsApp), those messages can be logged under the lead or customer.
- **Opportunity Tracking:** Convert qualified leads into **Opportunities** (a potential sale with more defined requirements)[\[31\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=,to%20ensure%20effective%20customer%20engagement). For instance, if a lead expresses serious interest in a bulk order, an Opportunity is recorded with expected deal size and probability of closing. Opportunities can have stages (Prospecting → Quotation Sent → Negotiation → Won/Lost).
- **Quotation and Pipeline Integration:** From an Opportunity, users can directly create a **Quotation** in the Selling module. The CRM pipeline view shows all open opportunities and their stages, giving a visual of the sales funnel (e.g., how many deals are likely this month). In a small business context, this might be a simple list with color codes for stage.
- **Customer Conversion:** When a lead or opportunity is "won" (customer decides to buy), the system can convert that lead into a formal **Customer** record (if not already) and link any successful Opportunity to the resulting Sales Order (in Selling module). This provides traceability from initial contact to actual sale.
- **Activity Management:** Manage tasks, calls, and meetings. The CRM module often includes a calendar or task list view of all upcoming customer-related activities[\[32\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=information%2C%20transaction%20history%2C%20and%20communication,customer%20behavior%2C%20and%20CRM%20effectiveness). For example, "Visit Shoprite distributor on 5th Dec" could be an event in the system. This ensures commitments to customers or prospects are not forgotten.
- **Loyalty and Customer Feedback (if applicable):** In a more advanced scenario, CRM can handle loyalty program data (points, tiers) and store customer feedback or support issues (overlap with Support module). For an MVP, a simple notes field or tagging important customers ("VIP") might suffice.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Lead Deduplication:** The system should help avoid duplicate leads/customers. If someone enters a new lead with an email or phone that matches an existing customer, it should alert or auto-link to the existing record to maintain one profile per person/company.
- **Follow-up Discipline:** If a next follow-up date is set for a lead or opportunity, the system could enforce that a new date must be set when completing the current follow-up, preventing "orphaned" leads with no next action. This ensures continuous engagement until closed or lost.
- **Opportunity Stage Progression:** Not strictly enforced, but generally an opportunity should not skip stages without reason (the system might log a change in probability or expected closing date so managers/owners can see if things are accelerating or stalled).
- **Customer Credit Tracking:** A simplified CRM in a township context might incorporate **informal credit** tracking - e.g., if a loyal customer buys on credit, the amount owed could be recorded in their profile (or via Accounts). Business rule: a customer owing beyond a certain amount could trigger a warning on new sales (tying back into Selling validations).
- **Data Privacy:** By POPIA compliance, personal info of leads/customers (names, contacts) should be protected. The system will ensure only authorized users can see full contact details, and that there's consent for things like promotional messages. If a lead opts out of communications, mark them as such and exclude from bulk SMS, etc.

**Data Model & Key Fields:** Main entities in CRM:

- **Lead:** Fields for lead name (or organization), contact info (phone, email), source of lead (referral, walk-in, social media, etc.), and a status (Open, Contacted, Converted, Do Not Contact). It may also have a field for interested products or notes on inquiry.
- **Opportunity:** Fields include linked customer/lead, opportunity type (sale, project, etc.), items or services of interest (sometimes a child table listing what they want, with estimated amounts), expected closing date, stage, probability (% chance to win), and an expected value (which could be auto-calculated or entered). Also an owner (salesperson responsible).
- **Contact & Address:** Master data for contacts and addresses, which can link to customers or suppliers. A lead might auto-create a Contact record when converted. Key fields: phone numbers, email, and address lines.
- **Customer (from Selling module):** Once a lead is converted, the Customer record holds long-term info like credit limit, loyalty points (if any), etc., and is used for actual transactions.
- **Communication Log:** A timeline of communications (this might be a unified doctype capturing any emails, call notes, etc. linked to Lead/Opportunity/Customer). Fields: date, medium (call, email), summary, and reference link.
- **ToDo/Reminder:** A simple doctype for tasks or follow-ups. Fields: description, due date, linked to (could be a lead or opportunity), assigned to user.

**User Interface & Experience:** The CRM interface should present a **"Customer Pipeline"** view that's easy to scan on mobile. This could be a kanban board of opportunities by stage, or simply grouped lists: New Leads, In Progress, Won, Lost. On a small phone screen, likely a list with badges for stage might be better. Each lead or opportunity entry in the list shows key info (name, deal amount or interest, and next follow-up date). Tapping it opens a detail page where the user can scroll through contact info, notes, past communications, and quick actions like "Call" or "Send SMS" (which if tapped, can integrate with phone's dialer or WhatsApp). A big **"Convert to Sale"** button could be present when a deal is won, which then guides the user to create a Sales Order or Invoice in the Selling module.

The CRM module also provides a unified view of a customer's profile: even for existing customers (not just leads), the business owner can view their purchase history, any outstanding amounts (pulled from Accounting), and any open support tickets (from Support module). This 360° view helps in providing personalized service. The UI should keep things simple: for example, an **"Add Lead"** form with minimal fields (perhaps name and phone are all that's mandatory to start, the rest optional). The system can fill some info automatically - e.g., if a lead comes via the website inquiry form, it appears in CRM with source "Website" and relevant details pre-filled.

Mobile notifications are crucial: the app should remind the user each morning of any follow-ups due that day ("You have 2 follow-ups: Call Thabo, Meet with Dineo"). It should also alert when a lead has been idle too long or an opportunity is near its expected close date without an update.

**Offline Capabilities:** CRM activities revolve around communication, which often assumes connectivity. However, TOSS CRM still offers offline support for data entry and viewing. A user can access their lead and customer lists offline if those were previously synced. This means while on the road with poor signal, a salesperson can pull up a customer's phone number from the app (since contacts are cached) and make a call. They can also log call notes or create a new lead offline. These entries will be time-stamped and saved locally, then sync to the server when back online. If an appointment or follow-up was completed offline, the system syncs the update (so colleagues, if any, can see it's done). One limitation offline is sending emails or messages - those will queue. For instance, if a user writes an email reply to a lead in the CRM interface offline, the email will be sent out once connectivity returns (the system should make this seamless with a queued outbox). This ensures that even with spotty networks, the user can keep working - jotting down new prospect info or updating statuses - without losing information, and the data will reconcile with the central server later.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Tebogo runs a small catering business. She meets a potential client at a community event who is interested in a large order for a wedding next month. Using the TOSS CRM module on her phone, Tebogo quickly adds a_ _Lead: "Naledi Mokgoko - wedding catering for 200 guests, event on Jan 15". She enters Naledi's phone number and sets a follow-up for next week to discuss menu and pricing. Back at the shop, Tebogo elaborates this entry into an_ _Opportunity_ _with an estimated value and probability. Over the next few days, she uses the CRM to log communications: Naledi prefers SMS, so Tebogo's replies via WhatsApp Web are noted in the system (she copies key points into a comment on the opportunity). The system prompts Tebogo with a task: "Send quotation by Friday". Tebogo creates a_ _Quotation_ _(via Selling module) directly from the Opportunity, selecting menu packages. Naledi confirms the quote, so Tebogo marks the Opportunity as_ _Won_ _and converts Naledi into a Customer in the system. A_ _Sales Order_ _is generated for the event. Throughout, the CRM kept Tebogo on track - even reminding her to ask for feedback after the event. She also uses CRM to track her regular lunch customers: she notes who her top 10 repeat customers are and their preferences (extra spicy, vegetarian, etc.) in the Customer records. Now, when any of those customers call, she has their history at her fingertips and can greet them by name, building loyalty._

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** AI in the CRM module serves as a virtual sales assistant and customer analyst. For example, the AI can rank leads by likelihood to convert, based on factors like response time or similarity to past successful leads (e.g., "This lead is similar to your best customer profile"). It might highlight dormant leads: "You haven't contacted Thabo in 3 weeks, and he was interested in a big order - consider reaching out again." For opportunities, the AI can forecast which deals might close this month by analyzing pipeline and past conversion rates[\[33\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=stages%20of%20the%20sales%20funnel,and%20ensure%20accurate%20order%20fulfillment). It can also watch engagement: if a lead hasn't responded to two messages, the AI might suggest a different approach or offer ("Lead Sam hasn't replied - maybe offer a small first-time discount to entice him"). Another insight is **customer segmentation** - the AI can categorize customers (e.g., big spenders, frequent small buyers, seasonal customers) and prompt targeted actions. In a rural context, this could be as simple as "Your top 5 customers drove 40% of sales - perhaps reward them with a thank you or bonus." If integrated with social media or WhatsApp, AI could help draft friendly broadcast messages for promotions, tuned to the local tone and language.

Moreover, the AI ties CRM with other modules: It knows which customers owe money (from Accounting) and can caution before new sales ("Note: This customer has an outstanding balance of R500" - credit control). It also knows stock levels and can avoid missed opportunities: if a lead asked for an item that was out of stock, once that item is restocked, the system reminds the user to inform the interested leads. Essentially, the AI ensures no opportunity is forgotten and every customer feels attended to, acting as a smart CRM coach.

**Collaborative Network Features:** CRM is inherently about relationships, and the collaborative aspect in TOSS can extend to community-wide customer engagement. One scenario is **shared leads or referrals** among businesses. For instance, if one business gets a query for something they don't offer, they can forward that lead to another trusted business on the platform (with the lead's permission). TOSS could facilitate this by allowing a lead to be shared as an opportunity to another tenant, logging the referral. This could be common in a cooperative or business network: a hardware shop might refer a construction project lead to a bricks supplier, or a salon might refer a customer looking for a product to a neighboring general dealer. The system can track referrals and even automate a small referral incentive if applicable ("Refer a customer to any network shop and earn points").

Another network angle: **Community loyalty program.** Multiple small businesses could unite under a single loyalty program (e.g., a township "Buy Local Rewards" card). TOSS CRM would then handle points that are accumulated across different shops. This requires sharing a customer's identity (with consent) across tenants. For example, a customer registers once, and whenever they shop at any participating store, the sale is recorded towards their loyalty points. The CRM module in each tenant's app would identify the customer (perhaps via phone number or a QR code on a card) and update the central loyalty ledger. This fosters customer retention within the network - a customer is encouraged to patronize any shop in the TOSS network to maximize their rewards. The CRM module and Network layer would jointly manage the rules (points per rand spent, tier levels) and redemptions (maybe a standardized reward catalog or store-specific offers).

Privacy and trust are paramount - by default, each business sees only their own customer data. If the network implements a shared program, customers would explicitly opt-in, and their basic profile might be visible to participating stores (possibly through a secure lookup service rather than a full data share). Event-driven triggers would handle things like "Customer reached 1000 points - notify them of a reward" across the network.

In summary, CRM's collaborative aspect in TOSS is about **referral sharing** and **joint customer engagement initiatives** that individual micro-businesses alone might struggle to maintain, but together they can, strengthening the local business ecosystem.

## Stock (Inventory Management Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Stock (Inventory) module enables businesses to **track and control their inventory** of products and materials across one or multiple locations. It covers maintaining item details, recording stock movements (incoming and outgoing), and providing real-time stock levels and valuations[\[23\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=The%20Stock%20or%20Inventory%20module,in%20ERPNext%20helps%20you%20to). This ensures that small businesses know exactly what they have in stock, what's running low, and where their goods are. Given the offline, rural context, the Stock module is designed to be simple to use (no complicated warehouse jargon) while robust enough to prevent losses due to stockouts, expiries, or shrinkage.

**Core Workflows:** Key processes in the Stock module include:

- **Item Master Management:** Define all **Items** (products, raw materials, supplies) in the system with unique codes and essential attributes (unit of measure, default selling/purchasing rates, whether it's tracked in stock, etc.). For example, a 500g bread loaf is an item with perhaps a SKU code.
- **Stock In** (Inbound Movements): These can happen via:
- **Purchase Receipts:** When goods are bought and received (from the Buying module), stock levels increase in the designated Warehouse.
- **Stock Entries (Material Receipt):** Direct adjustments, e.g., if opening balance stock is recorded or if stock is donated/free. Also used for production (finished goods coming in from manufacturing).
- **Returns In:** Sales returns add items back to stock.
- **Stock Out** (Outbound Movements): These include:
- **Delivery Notes / Sales Invoices:** Selling an item reduces its stock in the warehouse.
- **Stock Entries (Material Issue):** For recording waste, damage, or other write-offs (e.g., expired goods thrown away).
- **Returns Out:** If returning goods to a supplier, reducing stock.
- **Stock Transfers:** Move stock between **Warehouses** (locations). E.g., from main storage to shop front, or between branches. A Stock Entry of type "Transfer" handles this. For multi-location businesses or future hub-and-spoke operations, this is important.
- **Stock Reconciliation (Stock Take):** Periodically (or continuously) allow counting physical stock and reconciling with system. A **Stock Reconciliation** document can be used to adjust the system's quantities to match actual counts, posting any discrepancies to an accounting difference account.
- **Batch & Serial Management:** If enabled for certain items (like medicines with batch numbers or appliances with serial numbers), the module supports tracking by batch (with expiry dates) or serial (unique item IDs). This includes selecting specific batch/serial on stock transactions and ensuring their availability.
- **Valuation & Ledger:** Maintain a **Stock Ledger** and **Stock Balance** for each item, recording every quantity change with timestamp and reference document[\[34\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=The%20Stock%20or%20Inventory%20module,in%20ERPNext%20helps%20you%20to). Also maintain stock valuation (using methods like FIFO or moving average) to know the inventory value for accounting.
- **Reports & Alerts:** Provide reports like Current Stock Levels, Stock Ledger (history of movements), Stock Aging (how long items have stayed unsold), and Low Stock Report. Alerts for low stock are generated if items drop below their re-order level.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **No Negative Stock (Configurable):** By default, the system should prevent issuing stock if not enough quantity is available. For example, you cannot deliver 10 units if only 5 are in stock (unless a setting to allow negative stock is turned on for flexibility, but then an alert is raised). This ensures stock figures don't go unrealistically negative and catches potential mistakes.
- **Warehouse Mandatory:** All stock transactions must specify a **Warehouse** (even if a small business has only one stock location, a default "Main Store" warehouse is used). This helps future expansion (multiple shops or storage areas) and ensures location tracking. The system validates that the warehouse exists and the item is allowed there (items might be stored in all warehouses by default).
- **Batch/Serial Integrity:** If an item is batch-managed, any outgoing transaction must specify a valid batch that exists with sufficient quantity. Similarly for serial-managed items, each serial number can only be in one place at a time, and once sold or removed, it cannot be picked again unless returned. The system enforces unique serial numbers and tracks their status (available, sold, etc.).
- **Valuation Consistency:** Transactions affecting stock value (buying, selling, adjustments) create corresponding accounting entries (stock asset debits/credits) in the background. The system ensures the total valuation in accounting matches the stock ledger valuation for each item. If not (due to manual journal or error), it flags a reconciliation needed.
- **FIFO for Expiry:** For perishable goods, the system should support **First-Expiring-First-Out** logic. While not strictly enforced without batch metadata, if batches have expiry dates, it can warn users to sell or use those expiring soon first. Business rule: do not allow issuing expired stock (the system can warn or block if the batch date is past).
- **Stock Lock Period:** Optionally, a business might lock older stock entries after accounts are finalized (e.g., no adjustments in a closed month). If a user tries to post a back-dated stock entry in a locked period, it should be prevented.
- **Auto-Reorder Triggers:** When stock goes below reorder level, the system marks that item as "To Reorder". This can trigger creation of Material Requests or notifications (as described in Buying). The business rule is that reorder suggestion should only fire if there isn't already an open PO or if last reorder hasn't arrived, to avoid duplication (i.e., consider on-order quantities).
- **Unit of Measure (UOM) Consistency:** If multiple UOMs are used (like selling by unit but stocking by box), proper conversion factors must be defined. The system ensures that any stock transaction is converted to the base stock UOM for accounting and quantity tracking.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Item:** Central master with fields: Item Code, Item Name, Item Group (category), default UOM, whether it is Stock Item, Opening Stock quantity (for initial load), valuation method, standard buying/selling rates, reorder level and reorder quantity (per warehouse), and flags for batch/serial tracking.
- **Warehouse:** Master for locations (could be a physical location or virtual grouping). Fields: Warehouse Name, Parent (for hierarchy, e.g., Region > Site > Section), and possibly capacity info. For small use, likely just a flat list (e.g., "Store Room", "Shop Front").
- **Stock Ledger Entry:** Each stock move creates entries here (not usually directly viewed by users except in reports). Fields: Item, Warehouse, Date/Time, Voucher Type (e.g., Delivery Note), Voucher No., Qty In/Out, Balance Qty after, and Value change.
- **Stock Balance (computed):** Not a doctype, but the system maintains running totals per item per warehouse.
- **Stock Entry:** A document used for various internal stock movements or adjustments. Fields: Purpose (Material Issue, Receipt, Transfer, Reconciliation, Manufacture, etc.), From/To Warehouse, Item lines (item, qty, source and target warehouse for transfers, and optionally an expense account for write-off).
- **Batch:** If used, fields: Item, Batch ID, Manufacture/Expiry dates, quantity currently in stock (system maintained).
- **Serial No:** Fields: Serial Number, Item, purchase and sale info (if sold, to whom, when), current Warehouse (or status like "Delivered").
- **UOM and UOM Conversion:** Master of Units of Measure and mapping (e.g., 1 Case = 12 Each) if needed.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Stock module should present an **Inventory Dashboard** at a glance: e.g., total stock value on hand, number of items in stock, and alerts like "5 items below re-order level"[\[26\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L500-L508). On mobile, this might be a simple list of those alerts and a searchable list of items. The **Item list** view shows each item's available quantity (possibly only for a default warehouse unless expanded). Tapping an item shows its **Item Card**: including a photo (if uploaded), description, current stock in each warehouse, reorder level, recent transactions (last 5 movements or so), and maybe a quick action to "Adjust Stock" or "Reorder".

Performing a stock transaction (like an adjustment) is made easy: e.g., to record wastage of an item, a user can go to that Item's page and hit "Adjust Stock" - the app then asks "How many did you remove from stock and why?" with a simple interface (e.g., "Quantity: 2, Reason: Expired" and it creates a Stock Entry for Material Issue behind the scenes to reduce stock). This is crucial for non-technical users so they don't need to navigate accounting or journal entries - just a straightforward question-and-answer flow.

For stock counts, the UI could have a **Stock Take mode**: generate a checklist of items to count (maybe filter by warehouse or category), input counted numbers, and then finalize adjustments. Possibly allow printing or exporting a count sheet if done on paper then input results.

The mobile UI uses clear terms: "Stock" for inventory, "Add Stock" or "Remove Stock" rather than technical terms. In low-connectivity scenarios, heavy data like item images can be deferred unless requested, to keep the app responsive.

**Offline Capabilities:** The Stock module must work robustly offline because stock operations might be done in back rooms or warehouses without internet. The app will cache the **item master** and current stock levels so that even offline, a user can see what they **think** should be on the shelf as per system. They can then do a count and input adjustments offline. All types of stock entries (receipts, issues, transfers) can be initiated offline. The data (with timestamps) will sync later. The system uses local storage to queue up transactions, and each is applied in order once online, with conflict resolution if needed. For example, two offline adjustments on the same item: when syncing, they'll apply sequentially as recorded.

One complexity offline is **stock reservations** (like for Sales Orders) - but the system design likely keeps critical reservation logic server-side to avoid conflict. So, if offline POS sales are happening, they will sync and reduce stock; the system might accept temporary negative stock until synchronization resolves actual sequence of events (especially if multiple devices selling the same item offline). The platform addresses this by making stock transactions idempotent and reconciled via timestamps or a central queue on sync[\[35\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L316-L324). If any discrepancy arises (e.g., stock went negative or two sales claim the last item), the system generates an alert for manual reconciliation. However, such cases are minimized by providing the latest known stock info to each device before going offline and possibly locking certain operations if clearly not feasible (for instance, if a user tries to transfer stock offline from a warehouse that was at zero, the app should warn them).

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Ayanda manages a community pharmacy. In her stock room, network is unreliable. She uses TOSS Stock module on a tablet to do a weekly inventory check. The app, even offline, shows her current expected quantities. She notices some discrepancies: e.g., for Paracetamol tablets, system says 100 packs, but she counts 95. She enters an adjustment (5 units lost due to damage or theft). For certain medicines, she tracks batch and expiry - one batch of vitamins is expiring next month. The system had already alerted her a month ago about this ("Batch #VIT100 will expire in 30 days"), so she ran a promotion to sell them faster. During stock take, she finds only 2 bottles left of that batch, which she removes from display. She records in TOSS a_ _Material Issue_ _of 2 units with reason "Expired". All these changes are done offline in the storeroom. Later, when she goes to the front of the shop with connectivity, the tablet syncs: stock levels update on the central server, and accounting entries for the write-offs are posted automatically. Meanwhile, throughout the week, every sale made via the POS also decreased stock in real-time (or near real-time if offline). Ayanda uses the Low Stock Report to see that certain fast-moving items (cough syrup, sanitizer) are below their reorder levels_[_\[36\]_](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=,time%20information%20via%20reports)_. She quickly creates a Purchase Order for those via the Buying module. TOSS's AI notices a trend that cough syrup sells faster during the winter season and suggests that Ayanda should maintain a higher minimum level for winter months._

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** The AI layer supercharges the Stock module by acting as an inventory analyst for the business. Key AI-driven features include **reorder suggestions and stock alerts**: the system doesn't just use static reorder levels, but dynamically adjusts recommendations based on recent sales velocity and upcoming events[\[25\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L222-L225)[\[37\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L510-L514). For example, if an item's sales have spiked due to a flu outbreak, the AI will suggest ordering more before the usual threshold. It might say, "You usually reorder at 10 units remaining, but 10 sold in the last 2 days - increase your reorder quantity or you'll run out." The AI also flags **dead stock** - items that haven't sold in a long time. It could gently remind: "Item X hasn't sold in 60 days. Consider a discount or promotion to clear it." or suggest returning it to supplier if possible.

For perishable goods, the AI monitors expiry dates and proactively warns: "5 bottles of milk will expire next week[\[37\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L510-L514). Propose a discount to sell them in time." If integrated with the POS, it might even prompt the cashier to upsell those expiring items at a discount. The AI also keeps an eye on **stock valuation and shrinkage**. If the system sees frequent stock adjustments for losses, it surfaces that pattern: "Stock adjustments for Item Y have occurred 3 times this month, totaling R500 - potential theft or spoilage issue." This helps the owner catch problems early.

Another insight: **optimal stock levels** and **storage costs**. The AI can learn seasonal patterns and suggest changes in reorder levels: e.g., "It's rainy season - demand for umbrellas rises. Keep at least 20 in stock instead of 5." Conversely, "Demand for cold drinks drops in winter - lower your reorder level to save cash." These suggestions mimic an experienced inventory planner guiding a novice business owner.

Additionally, for multi-warehouse setups (or later, a central depot plus shops), the AI assists in **stock redistribution**. For example, if one branch has surplus of an item and another has shortage, it can recommend a transfer: "Shop A has 30 units of maize meal (10 above optimal), Shop B is out of stock - consider transferring 10 units from A to B." In a collaborative sense, this extends to the network: if Ayanda has excess of something nearing expiry, the AI might alert nearby shops in the network that could take some off her hands (better than it expiring - covered in Network section).

**Collaborative Network Features:** Inventory is an area ripe for collaboration in TOSS. One major feature is **Shared Inventory Visibility** for network participants who opt in. For example, a group of independent shops in the same area may agree to make certain stock info visible to each other (perhaps just quantity available of key items). The Stock module, via the network layer, could then show that "Neighbors have X in stock" for an item. This enables a few collaborative scenarios:

- **Cross-store Fulfillment:** If Shop A runs out of an item but Shop B (nearby) has it, Shop A can quickly arrange to get it from B (either by purchasing at cost or borrowing and returning later). TOSS can facilitate generating the necessary documents: a stock transfer or an inter-company sale/purchase. This helps prevent lost sales due to stockouts and fosters a supportive network.
- **Group Stock Monitoring:** A wholesaler or supplier on the platform (if included as a tenant or connected system) might monitor the stock levels of all connected shops for their products (with permission) to proactively plan deliveries (Vendor Managed Inventory concept). For example, a beverage supplier could see when each shop's soda stock is low and preemptively send a refill truck - improving efficiency for both supplier and shop. The Stock module would publish low-stock events to such partners if configured.
- **Shared Warehouse or Depot:** In some communities, businesses could co-own a storage facility for bulk goods. TOSS can manage that by treating the depot as a separate tenant or a shared warehouse where each business has an allocated section (or share). The collaborative aspect is that multiple businesses' stock might physically reside together. The system would carefully segregate ownership in records but allow a combined view for the depot manager. Events like group purchases delivered to the shared depot are split into each owner's stock via the system (like a distribution).
- **Pooling for Insurance / Financing:** Knowing the total inventory value across the network could enable group insurance or collateral for loans. While not directly a Stock module feature, the data from Stock feeds into such network-level initiatives. E.g., "All shops together have R500k of inventory; use this as collateral for a group credit line." TOSS could produce a combined inventory report (with consent) for a lender or insurer, an example of cross-tenant reporting.

Permissions and data isolation are crucial. The default is no one sees another's stock. Any sharing is opt-in at a granular level (maybe per item or category, and whether exact quantities or just "in/out of stock" status). The Collaborative layer triggers - e.g., low stock alerts can be optionally broadcast: a shop could flag an alert "I need 20 units of Item Z, anyone have excess?" which others receive and can respond to. Underneath, if they agree, the system converts it to a formal transfer request.

In short, the Stock module in a network context helps the community act like a virtual co-op: sharing surplus, jointly avoiding stockouts, and aggregating their inventory information for mutual benefit (like bulk buying and shared storage). This kind of coordination, traditionally difficult for disparate small entities, is made possible through the real-time data and event sharing that TOSS enables[\[37\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L510-L514).

## Accounting (Finance Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Accounting module handles the financial backbone of the platform, recording all **money in and money out** so business owners can see their financial health at a glance. It covers bookkeeping tasks such as invoicing, payments, expenses, and financial reports (income statement, balance sheet) - but TOSS presents these in a simplified, jargon-free manner suitable for non-accountants[\[38\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L202-L208). The purpose is to ensure every transaction in other modules (sales, purchases, payroll, etc.) reflects in the books automatically, giving an accurate picture of cash flow and profitability without requiring the user to be a finance expert.

**Core Workflows:** Key accounting processes include:

- **Sales and Accounts Receivable:** Every **Sales Invoice** (from Selling module) flows into accounting, logging income and if on credit, an accounts receivable entry for the customer[\[39\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=In%20ERPNext%2C%20accounting%20operations%20consists,of%203%20main%20transactions). Users can record **Payments Received** against customer invoices (or as advance payments). If a customer buys on credit (informal 'book'), the system tracks that outstanding amount under their name.
- **Purchases and Accounts Payable:** Every **Purchase Invoice** (from Buying module) logs an expense and accounts payable to the supplier[\[39\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=In%20ERPNext%2C%20accounting%20operations%20consists,of%203%20main%20transactions). Users record **Payments Made** to suppliers, which settle those liabilities. The system can manage partial payments or prepayments and adjust accordingly.
- **Expense Tracking (Petty Cash):** The business can record expenses that are not through a supplier invoice - e.g., cash expenses like fuel, minor equipment, or staff lunch. This could be via a **Payment Entry** coded to an expense account or a simplified **Expense Voucher** form. TOSS will allow quick logging of such outflows to keep the "What's left" accurate.
- **Cash Management:** The module monitors cash/bank balances. **Cash Register/POS closing** is part of this: at day's end, tally cash collected from sales versus system-calculated cash, then create an entry if there's over/short. Bank deposits or withdrawals can be recorded too.
- **General Journal & Adjustments:** For completeness, accountants can pass **Journal Entries** (e.g., to record depreciation, corrections, or owner drawings). This is advanced usage; the UI for normal users might hide this, but it's available under the hood or for accountants' access.
- **Payroll Entries:** Integration from HR - salary payouts are recorded (e.g., via a journal entry or expense entry posting to salaries expense and reducing cash/bank).
- **Financial Reporting:** The system generates basic reports: **Profit & Loss (Income Statement)**, **Balance Sheet**, and **Cash Flow**. For user-friendliness, these are phrased in simple terms (Income vs. Expenses, Assets vs. Liabilities). Also, a **Trial Balance** and **General Ledger** report for accountants. On the dashboard, a simplified view "Money In / Money Out / What's Left" is shown, which essentially is cash flow: money received this month, money spent, and net remaining[\[38\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L202-L208).
- **Tax Management:** If the business is VAT registered or has any tax obligations, the module helps accumulate tax from sales and purchases (input VAT, output VAT) for filing. For very small informal businesses, this might be disabled, but for those in formal sector, it's important. TOSS can produce a tax report if needed (aligning with local tax like South African VAT requirements[\[40\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=Introduction)).

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Double-Entry Integrity:** The module enforces that every financial transaction is balanced (debits = credits). Users typically won't see debits/credits, as forms abstract it (e.g., on a Payment form they just pick from which account to pay and which invoice to settle, system does the rest). But under the hood, if anything unbalanced is attempted, it will error - ensuring accounts always remain consistent.
- **Period Closure:** Optionally, monthly or yearly books can be "closed" to prevent backdated entries that alter past numbers. If March is closed, you can't book something into March anymore, only April onward, unless you have permission and reopen.
- **Unique Invoice Numbering:** Sales and Purchase Invoices likely need unique numbering (and maybe sequential, as per some regulations). The system auto-generates these, but ensures no duplicates and maintains sequence (especially if multiple offline invoices sync, it might assign numbers on sync to keep sequence).
- **Negative Accounting Entries Prevention:** E.g., you shouldn't create a payment entry for more money than the invoice amount (no overpayment without credit note logic), or a credit note exceeding original invoice. The system validates such conditions.
- **Currency Handling:** If multi-currency transactions occur (like buying from a supplier in USD), the system manages conversion rates and gains/losses. The rule is each invoice has a defined currency and rate, and the base (company) currency is always updated. Exchange rate fields must be filled and consistent.
- **Tax Compliance:** If taxes are applied, relevant fields (tax amount, tax type) must be present. The system can enforce tax inclusive/exclusive consistency. Also, if a customer or supplier is tax-exempt, it must be flagged so invoices don't charge incorrectly.
- **AR/AP Aging:** Keep track of credit periods. If a customer's invoice goes beyond due date unpaid, system flags it (for follow-up). Similarly for supplier payments. Possibly a simple rule: highlight any invoice over e.g. 30 days due as overdue.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Chart of Accounts (COA):** A hierarchical list of accounts (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, Expenses). TOSS would provide a default simple COA suitable for small retail (with accounts like Cash, Bank, Inventory, Accounts Receivable/Payable, Sales, Purchases, Expenses, etc.). Each transaction posts to relevant accounts. Key fields: account name, type, balance.
- **Sales Invoice:** Fields - customer, date, due date, item lines (each posting to income and maybe tax accounts), totals, and posting status. Flags for credit note or returns.
- **Purchase Invoice:** Fields - supplier, date, due date, items/expenses lines (posting to expense or stock accounts), taxes, and payment status.
- **Payment Entry:** A document for recording payment. Fields - party type (Customer/Supplier), party name, date, amount, mode of payment (cash, bank, mobile money), accounts (from which account to which). It can have references to one or multiple invoices it settles.
- **Journal Entry:** Fields - date, remarks, a table of entries (Account, Debit amount, Credit amount). Used for adjustments not covered by dedicated forms.
- **Expense Claim/Voucher (if separate):** Possibly a simpler form for internal expenses. Fields - expense type, amount, date, paid by whom or to whom.
- **GL Entry:** The behind-the-scenes record for every debit/credit. Fields - account, date, voucher type and ID (linking to invoice, etc.), debit amount, credit amount, balance. Used for ledger reports.
- **Company:** Master record for the business's details (currency, financial year start, default accounts, etc. - though in multi-tenant each tenant has their own).
- **Fiscal Year:** If needed, defines financial year periods.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Accounting UI in TOSS aims to demystify accounting. It likely features a **Finance Dashboard** with three big numbers: Money In, Money Out, and Cash Balance (or Profit)[\[38\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L202-L208). For example, "This Month: Sales R10,000 - Expenses R7,000 - What's Left R3,000" in bold, friendly format. It may also show counters like "Unpaid Customer Invoices: 2 (total R1,200)" and "Upcoming Bills: 1 (R500 due next week)".

The navigation avoids accounting terms where possible: instead of "General Ledger", say "All Transactions" or simply present the detail when needed. There could be a toggle for "Simple view" vs "Advanced view". In simple view (default for most users), you see invoices, payments, and expenses in plain language. For example, to record an expense, the UI might literally have a button "Record an Expense" - clicking it presents a form: "What did you pay for? \[text or choose category\], How much? \[amount\], When? \[date\], How did you pay? \[cash/bank\]". The system behind will pick the right accounts (like debit an expense account, credit cash/bank) without the user choosing from the chart of accounts. Categories could map to accounts (e.g., "Transport" goes to Travel Expense account).

Similarly, receiving money (aside from sales via invoices) can be "Record Other Income" if needed. But for most, sales and purchase modules feed in so they don't manually create incomes or COGS entries.

For users with knowledge or accountants, an advanced mode allows seeing the actual accounts and journal entries.

Mobile UI for creating a Payment: if paying a supplier, the user could just go to that Purchase Invoice and tap "Pay Now", then enter amount and select cash or bank. The app then marks it paid and creates the ledger entry. For receiving from a customer, could do the same from Sales Invoice "Receive Payment".

**Reporting**: The P&L and Balance Sheet can be shown but with an option for simplified language. For example, P&L might be labeled "Income minus Expenses Report", showing just key headings: Total Income, Total Expense, Net Profit. The user can tap to expand categories if they want detail. Balance Sheet might be "What You Have and What You Owe", showing assets (cash, receivables, stock), liabilities (payables, loans), and net worth. These are static reports updated in real-time with transactions.

**Offline Capabilities:** Much of accounting happens automatically via other modules. If those modules function offline (e.g., an offline sale or a logged expense), then the underlying accounting entries will queue and sync. For example, a POS sale offline still creates a sales invoice and payment internally; that will sync to the server later and update accounts. The Accounting module interface itself (reports) might not be available offline in full because it needs up-to-date aggregate data. However, the app could cache the last known dashboard values or reports from last sync for reference. Logging a payment or expense offline is possible - say you pay a supplier in cash while offline, you can record that payment in the app; it will mark the invoice as paid locally and queue the payment entry. Upon syncing, the central records update. The system takes care to prevent duplicate payment entries (for instance, if two users try to log the same payment offline, which is unlikely in a small biz scenario with one bookkeeper, but possible with multiple staff).

In short, any transaction entry can be done offline (the forms are available), but consolidated views (like trial balance) may only refresh when online and synced.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Sizwe runs a general dealer. He isn't an accountant, but he uses TOSS to keep track of finances. Every sale and purchase already flows into TOSS Accounting without extra work - so at month's end, he checks the_ _Money In/Out_ _dashboard: it says "Income: R50,000, Expenses: R40,000, Left: R10,000 (Profit)" for that month. This makes sense to him immediately. He also notices 2_ _Unpaid Sales_ _where some customers bought on credit; the Accounting module lists them with names and amounts (almost like an_ _"Owed to You"_ _list). He can politely remind those customers. He also sees_ _Upcoming Bills_\* - his rent and an invoice from a supplier - so he ensures enough cash is reserved.

During the month, Sizwe had some cash expenses: buying diesel for the generator (not from a usual supplier). He taps "Record Expense", selects category "Utilities/Fuel", enters R200, and marks it as paid from Cash. TOSS adds that to his expenses. He also paid his one staff member their weekly wages - he records this as an expense under "Wages" category, R800. All this while offline (as the connectivity in the village is spotty), but the app saved it. Later, when he gets a signal, these entries sync and his accountant (who reviews things quarterly) will see them too.

When Sizwe's accountant logs in (maybe via a desktop web interface of TOSS), she can switch to an **Accountant View** that shows the full chart of accounts and ledger. She verifies that all sales and purchase entries have proper ledgers (they do). She uses the **Journal Entry** tool to record depreciation of Sizwe's refrigerator asset and to adjust for a small loan interest. These require her expertise, but Sizwe doesn't have to worry - he just sees the updated net profit. At year's end, the accountant prints out a formal Income Statement and Balance Sheet from TOSS for tax filing, while Sizwe continues to rely on the simple daily view that TOSS provides him to run the business.\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** In the Accounting module, the AI acts as a **financial advisor** watching over the books. A vital feature is **cash flow forecasting and alerts**[\[28\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L114-L117). The AI will project upcoming cash inflows (based on open invoices, regular sales) against outflows (upcoming supplier payments, recurring expenses like rent) to warn the owner of any cash crunch. For example, "Alert: You have R5,000 due to suppliers next week, but based on recent sales you might only have R3,000 - consider reducing expenses or finding funds"[\[28\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L114-L117). This early warning can be crucial for small businesses to avoid surprise shortfalls.

Another insight: **expense analysis**. The AI can analyze expenses and flag unusual spikes ("Your electricity expense this month is 30% higher than usual") or identify areas to save costs ("Your phone data expenses are high relative to sales - consider a different plan"). It might also benchmark against similar businesses in the network (anonymously): "Shops like yours spend on average 5% of revenue on transport, you are spending 10%" - prompting Sizwe to investigate why or collaborate on delivery costs.

For revenue, AI can highlight profitability: which product lines have the best margins and which barely break even. If integrated with the inventory data, it can compute an approximate **gross profit margin** per item and advise dropping or repricing items with consistently low or negative margins (maybe due to waste or pricing issues). For instance, "Eggs were often sold at a loss after accounting for breakage - consider adjusting price or supplier."

The AI also ensures **compliance reminders**: if tax is enabled, it might say "VAT return due in 10 days, expected payment RX" (calculating from records). Or for formal businesses, "Don't forget to pay staff UIF/PAYE by the 7th."

Additionally, AI can encourage good practices: if a business hasn't reconciled its bank in a while (for those that do), it nudges them. Or if the owner tends to withdraw too much cash (owner's drawings), it could caution about depleting business capital.

In summary, the AI in Accounting serves to make financial management proactive and intelligible - catching issues a human might miss and translating the numbers into plain advice.

**Collaborative Network Features:** While accounting data is usually private, the network layer allows certain cooperative financial activities:

- **Group Financial Benchmarking:** Participating businesses can opt to compare financial metrics anonymously. TOSS could provide a feature where an owner sees how they stack up: e.g., "Your profit margin this quarter is 20%, the network average for retail shops is 25%." This helps identify if one's doing well or needs improvement in areas like cost control or pricing. All data shared would be aggregated and anonymized (no individual numbers revealed).
- **Creditworthiness & Group Funding:** If businesses want to access loans or credit as a group, they may allow a combined financial statement to be generated. The Collaborative layer could aggregate selected financial info (like total sales, net incomes of each, etc.) to present to a microfinance institution or an NGO for funding consideration. For example, 10 spazas apply for a group loan - the lender gets a consolidated view of the group's finances through TOSS (with permission). TOSS could even facilitate **peer guarantees** - where businesses can pledge to back each other's loans, recorded through a network agreement.
- **Multi-Entity Accounting:** In some cases, a cooperative might have a central entity plus individual member accounts. TOSS's multi-tenant design keeps them separate by default, but network features could help with things like **inter-company ledgers**. For example, when two shops do a stock transfer sale, one's books show a sale and the other a purchase automatically (which TOSS can post via linked entries across tenants).
- **Shared Services Costs:** If the network collectively pays for something (say a shared delivery truck or marketing campaign), TOSS can allocate the expense to each member's Accounting. For instance, a R1000 bill for group advertising is split evenly among 5 businesses - the system can inject an expense of R200 in each of their books (perhaps through an automated journal entry) after consensus. This requires trust and setup that likely a network admin or group feature would manage.

Given privacy concerns, any financial collaboration is opt-in and highly transparent. Likely, these features will be used in formal cooperatives or trusted groups rather than random businesses on the platform. Still, the infrastructure being multi-tenant with events allows such flows.

An example: _A group of 5 mechanics share a costly machine. They agree that each will contribute monthly to its maintenance fund. TOSS could create an automated schedule that each tenant (mechanic's account) gets a monthly expense "Equipment Fund Contribution" and one central account (maybe the coop account) logs the incoming contributions. This ensures everyone's books reflect their share of the cost._

Such collaborative accounting ensures fairness and clarity in shared financial commitments, reinforcing trust in group endeavors.

## Manufacturing (Production Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Manufacturing module helps businesses plan and manage the process of converting raw materials into finished products. For ERP-III, it covers everything from defining the **Bill of Materials (BOM)** for a product, scheduling production, issuing raw materials, to tracking work in progress and completed goods[\[41\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=The%20Manufacturing%20module%20in%20ERPNext,conduct%20various%20manufacturing%20operations%20effectively). In a township context, this could apply to small-scale manufacturers like bakeries, clothing makers, furniture workshops, etc. The module ensures that these businesses can efficiently produce goods, control their production costs, and maintain quality, all integrated with inventory and purchasing.

**Core Workflows:** Key manufacturing workflows include:

- **Bill of Materials (BoM) Definition:** Create a **BoM** for each manufactured item, listing all raw materials (and quantities) and perhaps labor or machine operations needed to produce one unit[\[42\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,work%20orders%20based%20on%20MoMs). E.g., a BoM for one loaf of bread might include 500g flour, 300ml water, 10g yeast, etc. BOMs can be multi-level (if sub-assemblies exist), but many small businesses will have single-level BOMs.
- **Production Planning:** Optionally, plan production based on demand. The user (or AI) decides how many units to make in a batch. **Production Plan** functionality can take Sales Orders or stock replenishment targets as input and suggest production quantities and schedule[\[43\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,insights%20into%20production%20performance%2C%20costs). For instance, if a bakery has orders for 100 loaves and expects storefront sales of 50, they plan a batch of 150 loaves tomorrow.
- **Work Order (Job Order) Execution:** Create a **Work Order** (Manufacturing Order) to manufacture a certain quantity of a product[\[44\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,meet%20quality%20standards%20through%20inspections). This is the authorization to produce. It specifies the product, quantity, and target completion date. Once a work order is submitted, it may reserve raw materials (or at least check availability).
- **Material Issue & Production:** When starting production, **Issue Raw Materials** from stock to Work in Progress (WIP). This could be through a Stock Entry of type Manufacture: it moves the required components from stores to the WIP (or directly consumes them). Then, **Completion**: once production is done, **Receive Finished Goods** into stock (and record any unconsumed raw material returned or wastage).
- **Job Cards/Operations (if detailed):** For more complex processes, define **Workstations** (e.g., oven, sewing machine) and **Operations** (steps like mixing, baking) with durations and maybe assign workers. **Job Cards** can track progress of each operation on the shop floor[\[45\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,and%20optimizing%20production%20runs%20to). In a simple scenario, this might be overkill, but it's available if needed (e.g., a dressmaker might have cutting and stitching operations).
- **Quality Inspection:** If quality checks are needed for finished goods (or intermediate), integrate with Quality module - e.g., automatically create a Quality Inspection for a batch produced. If items fail QA, mark as rejected or rework.
- **Manufacturing Reports:** Track production efficiency - actual vs. planned material usage, yield, time taken. For instance, if always more flour is used than BOM suggests, maybe BOM needs updating or process needs improvement.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **BoM Consistency:** A BoM can't have circular references (product including itself). The system ensures that all raw items exist in the item master and that quantities make sense (no zero or negative usage). Also, a BoM can be marked as default for producing that item.
- **Material Availability Check:** Before starting a Work Order, the system can check if required raw materials are available in stock. If not, it should prompt to procure or produce those first (or allow starting partially if that's allowed). A rule could be: can't start work order unless at least X% of materials are available.
- **Backflush vs Manual Issue:** The module can operate in backflush mode (automatically deduct raw materials upon completion based on BOM) or manual issue mode. If backflush is used, completing a Work Order will consume the exact BoM quantities from inventory. If manual, the user must issue materials via a separate step. The system enforces whichever mode is configured and prevents double consumption.
- **Work Order Quantity Flexibility:** If actual output is different from planned (maybe scrap or extra yield), system allows closing a Work Order with a different finished quantity, but it should warn if significantly different. Also, any variance in raw material usage should be recordable (waste, etc.).
- **Status Progression:** Work Order statuses: Draft → In Process (when started) → Completed (when finished goods produced) → Closed. Only one completion allowed unless using partial completion (some systems allow producing in tranches). The rules ensure you can't complete more than ordered unless explicitly allowed (over-production).
- **Costing:** The manufacturing module calculates production cost (sum of raw materials + overhead/labor). If integrated to accounts, upon completion, it can optionally post a **Manufacturing Journal**: credit WIP and raw material stock, debit finished goods stock with total cost[\[46\]](https://www.sigzen.com/erpnext/production-management/#:~:text=Image%3A%20check). This keeps inventory values accurate. The system must ensure cost roll-up is done (especially if any raw materials had no value set, it alerts).
- **Time Tracking (if used):** If operations have time, and job cards track actual time, the system might compare planned vs actual time. Business rule: any operation exceeding time could flag delay or cost overrun. If labor costs are tracked, those get added to production cost.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **BOM (Bill of Materials):** Fields - Product (finished good item), Quantity (usually 1 unit BOM), list of BOM Items (raw materials and qty required for that quantity), and possibly Operations (if routing defined). Also fields like BOM cost (materials + operation cost).
- **Work Order (Production Order):** Fields - Product to manufacture, Quantity to produce, BOM reference, Planned start date, Planned end date, actual start/end, status, and links to stock movements. It might have a child table for operations status if applicable.
- **Job Card (if used):** Fields - Operation, Work Order, workstation, assigned to (person), start time, end time, status (not started/started/completed), actual time taken.
- **Operation:** Fields - Operation name, description, workstation type or default, standard time per unit or batch.
- **Workstation:** Fields - Name of machine or station, capacity info (like hours available), maybe cost rate.
- **Stock Entries for Manufacture:** Same Stock Entry doctype but with type = Manufacture. It will have two sets of child items: consumed materials and produced goods. Key fields - Work Order reference, and for each consumed item (source warehouse), for produced item (target warehouse).
- **Material Request (Manufacturing type):** Optionally, if a production plan suggests to manufacture something, it may raise a request to produce.

**User Interface & Experience:** For small-scale manufacturing, the UI should simplify the process - possibly through a guided wizard or checklists:

For example, a **Work Order screen** might show: 1. Required materials and their availability (with a "Pick Materials" button to issue them). 2. A "Start Production" button to indicate production is underway (which could start a timer if tracking time, or just mark status). 3. A "Finish Production" button to record output quantity, scrap, etc., and automatically receive finished stock.

If using operations: once "Start" is hit, it could spawn tasks for each operation (job cards) which a user can mark as done. However, in many cases, that might be overkill - so the default UI might skip that unless turned on.

The BOM editor UI would allow adding materials easily, perhaps even with a recipe-like feel ("Add Ingredient" lines). On mobile, listing ingredients and quantities can be a simple form. Possibly allow capturing by scanning items to add them to BOM.

The **Manufacturing dashboard** might show open work orders and their progress, and maybe a calendar of planned production. If a user is producing daily, a simple list "Today's Production: item X - 100 units planned" could be shown.

Integration with inventory is key in UI: a user in the Work Order can tap "Check Stock & Reserve" which will show which raw materials are short, and perhaps a quick action to create a Purchase Order for those if needed.

Mobile usage scenario: A small bakery owner uses her phone to initiate a bread baking work order in the morning. The UI might have a special shortcut: "Make Product" where she selects "Bread" and enters 100 loaves. The system then does everything behind scenes: checks ingredients, suggests issuing them. She confirms she has enough flour, etc. She hits "Start". After baking, she hits "Finish - 100 made, 2 spoiled" maybe, and the system updates stock of bread and reduces stock of flour, yeast accordingly. This condenses multiple steps into a user-friendly sequence.

**Offline Capabilities:** Manufacturing operations often happen on-site where the server might not be reachable (imagine a workshop with thick walls or a remote area with poor connectivity). So TOSS allows production transactions offline as well. If a user starts a Work Order offline, it will be saved locally. They can issue materials (the app will still need to know current raw material stock, so it uses last synced data as reference - possibly warns if uncertain). They then mark completion offline. All these will sync and adjust central inventory when back online. To avoid major mismatches, maybe heavy manufacturing might mostly be done with some connectivity to update stock immediately (especially if raw materials are also being used in sales etc.), but the system will handle any double-use gracefully via sync conflict resolution (e.g., if offline work order consumed some flour while at the same time a POS sale sold flour, when syncing one may drive stock negative or cause an alert requiring reconciliation).

For recording job times offline (if job cards on a machine without internet), the app caching allows stamping start/stop times and then syncing them.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Neo runs a small dairy, producing cheese from milk collected from local farmers. Each week, he uses TOSS Manufacturing to plan production. He has a BOM for "Fresh Cheese (1kg)" which includes 10 liters of milk, culture, rennet, and salt. On Monday, Neo creates a_ _Work Order_ _for 50kg of Fresh Cheese to fulfill expected demand. TOSS shows he needs 500 liters of milk and other ingredients. He checks the stock: TOSS shows he has enough culture and salt, but only 300 liters of milk on hand. Via the app, he quickly generates a_ _Material Request_\* to procure the extra 200 liters from farmers (which Purchasing module will handle). By Tuesday, milk arrives and he records the Purchase Receipt for it, updating stock.

Now Neo issues the materials to production: he uses the "Pick Materials" function on the Work Order, which deducts 500 liters of milk and the required amounts of other ingredients from inventory into WIP. He starts production (he doesn't use detailed operations; he just needs to track start and end). After a day of work, he ends with 48kg of cheese (lost some yield in process). In TOSS, he completes the Work Order, entering actual output 48kg. The system consumes the materials (if any left unused, he could adjust, but in this case, all 500L used) and increases stock of Fresh Cheese by 48 units of 1kg each. The system also records the production cost: it knows how much he paid for the milk (and an overhead rate he set for labor), so it calculates cost per kg. Neo can now see that cost vs. his selling price to ensure profit.

During this, TOSS's Quality module popped up a reminder for **Quality Check**: one in five batches should be tested for moisture content. He performs a quick test and logs the result in a Quality Inspection linked to the Work Order, all within the app.

All of Neo's manufacturing entries were done in a remote dairy with spotty internet, so they queued up and synced in the evening when he got better signal. The stock levels for cheese and milk then updated on the central server, and an **Accounting** entry was posted moving the value of ingredients to the value of produced cheese.

Neo also uses the Manufacturing module for maintenance of equipment indirectly; every 100 batches, the machine needs service - TOSS tracks how many Work Orders have been done and alerts him at the right interval (via Maintenance in Support module).\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** The AI in manufacturing serves as a production planner and process optimizer. It can do **demand forecasting**: analyzing sales trends to suggest production quantities. For example, "Based on the last 4 weeks of sales, you should produce 10% more Mageu drink this week to meet rising demand[\[30\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L274-L282)." Conversely, if sales are dropping, it warns not to over-produce to avoid wastage. The AI also looks at **production efficiency**: it knows the expected yield from BOM vs actual recorded output. If consistently the actual output is lower, it will highlight this: "Your yield for beef biltong is averaging 90% of expected - check for process losses or update the BOM to reflect reality." If actual usage of raw mats is higher than BOM, it suggests checking for waste or theft.

Another AI feature is **Material Requirements Planning (MRP)** automation[\[47\]](https://www.sigzen.com/erpnext/production-management/#:~:text=). Instead of the user manually planning, the AI can automatically generate production plans. For instance, it sees low stock of a manufactured item and pending demand, so it could auto-create a draft Work Order (or at least recommend: "You should make 200 more units of Soap this month, will require X of ingredients - create Work Order?"). It also coordinates with purchasing: if a planned production will require more raw materials than available, the AI triggers a purchase suggestion (or auto-draft PO) for those raw mats, aligning procurement with production.

For scheduling, if multiple products use the same equipment, the AI can help avoid clashes and suggest an optimal sequence (especially if one product's output can be input for another or to minimize cleanup time between products, etc.). In a simple example, if a bakery makes both bread and cakes and has one oven, the AI might schedule bread first then cakes based on oven time needed and due times.

Quality-wise, AI can correlate quality results with process parameters, if data is available, to warn if certain trends might cause quality issues (this might be advanced, though - likely later).

**Collaborative Network Features:** In manufacturing, network collaboration might involve **outsourcing or subcontracting** between businesses. For example, one community bakery might have an oven capacity to also bake goods for smaller bakers. TOSS could allow a Work Order to be assigned to another business in the network (subcontracting)[\[48\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L430-L438). The system would then facilitate the inter-company transaction: one business provides raw materials to the other (or the other uses its own and charges), and finished goods are returned. The Collaborative layer would share the production request and track it. This way, smaller players can utilize idle capacity in the network.

Another scenario is **shared production planning** for complementary products. Suppose a co-op of seamstresses each makes different clothing items but share a pool of fabric bulk-bought. They could use TOSS to coordinate production schedules so that the fabric rolls are allocated fairly and orders are met collectively on time. This is more of a human coordination aided by transparency: each sees the overall production calendar (if permitted) and resource availability.

The network can also collectively negotiate raw material purchases for manufacturing (ties into group buying from Buying module), ensuring manufacturers get bulk rates on inputs like flour, fabric, etc., which lowers cost of production for all. TOSS would integrate that by linking production plans to those group purchases.

There's also knowledge sharing: proven BOMs or processes could be templatized and shared via the platform. E.g., one cheesemaker shares their BOM and process (maybe not exact secret recipe proportions if they don't want, but some may share best practices) - new entrepreneurs can import a BOM template from a public library as a starting point. This isn't exactly a network transaction, more of a communal knowledge base.

From a data perspective, the network could aggregate production metrics: total goods produced in the network, capacity usage, etc., useful if presenting to potential investors or development programs ("Our network of 5 bakeries produces 1000 loaves/day feeding X community").

In summary, manufacturing collaboration in TOSS allows distributed production resources to be used more efficiently, fosters subcontracting (which can create intra-network supply chains), and helps small manufacturers band together for economies of scale in input buying and process improvement.

## Projects (Project Management Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Projects module helps businesses plan and track project-based work - any initiative with multiple tasks, a timeline, and possibly resource assignments. This could range from client projects (like a construction job, event management, consulting task) to internal projects (like shop renovations or marketing campaigns). The module provides tools to break work into **tasks**, assign responsibilities, log time or progress, and ensure projects are delivered on schedule and within budget. It gives a structured approach to what might otherwise be managed in notebooks or not at all. For small organizations, this means even a one-off project (e.g., catering a big event, fulfilling a large order) can be managed systematically, increasing the chance of success and customer satisfaction[\[49\]](https://discuss.frappe.io/c/erpnext/projects/53#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20ERPNext%20Proejcts,discuss%2C%20and%20help%20other%20communi%E2%80%A6).

**Core Workflows:** Key features and flows in Projects include:

- **Project Creation:** Create a **Project** entry for each distinct project or job. Define basic info: name, start and end date, client (if applicable), budget or expected revenue, and project type (internal vs external).
- **Task Breakdown:** Under each project, define **Tasks** that need to be completed[\[49\]](https://discuss.frappe.io/c/erpnext/projects/53#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20ERPNext%20Proejcts,discuss%2C%20and%20help%20other%20communi%E2%80%A6). Each task has a description, an assignee (who will do it), a due date, and perhaps a status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed). Tasks may have dependencies (Task B can only start after Task A finishes, etc.) which can be noted.
- **Assignments & Team:** Assign tasks to team members or responsible persons. In small biz context, the "team" might be just the owner and one helper, but it could also involve external collaborators. Each assignee should be able to view their tasks easily (maybe via ToDo integration).
- **Time Tracking & Work Logs:** If needed, users can log **time (timesheets)** against tasks[\[50\]](https://discuss.frappe.io/t/about-the-project-management-category/56267#:~:text=About%20the%20Project%20Management%20category,category%2C%20you%20can%20post). For example, an electrician logs 5 hours spent on wiring (under a project for a shop installation). This is useful for projects billed on time & material or for measuring productivity. Timesheets can be consolidated to see total effort.
- **Progress Tracking:** Update task status or percent complete as work progresses. The project has an overall completion percentage based on tasks done. If using milestones, the project might have key milestones to mark.
- **Project Cost/Revenues:** Optionally link project to financials. Sales Invoices or Expenses can be tagged to a project so that one can compute profitability per project. E.g., a construction project might accumulate material costs (from Purchase Invoices) and revenue from a client invoice, all tied to that project.
- **Project Closure & Evaluation:** Once all tasks are done, mark project Completed/Closed. Possibly capture a summary or lessons learned.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Task Date Consistency:** The system ensures that task dates fall within the project's overall dates. If a task is set to end after project's end date, it could warn or auto-adjust project end.
- **Mandatory Fields:** Tasks should have either an assignee or a clear owner, and a due date for proper tracking. The system might nag if tasks are created without due dates.
- **Dependency Enforcement:** If Task B depends on Task A, the system could optionally prevent marking B as started until A is completed, or at least warn. And if A is delayed, possibly flag that B will slip.
- **Project Status Auto-Update:** When all tasks are marked complete, the system can auto-mark the project as Completed. Conversely, if any task reopens, project reopens.
- **Budget vs Actual:** If a project budget (cost or time) is set, the system tracks actual expenses or hours logged. If actuals exceed budget, it flags it. E.g., "Project X is over budget by 10%" or "Task Y took 15h vs planned 10h."
- **Permission Control:** Possibly restrict who can view certain projects if sensitive. For instance, only team members can see project details. (In small teams likely open, but the system supports that for bigger setups.)
- **Client Access:** Not likely in MVP, but ERPNext allows a client to have portal view of their project. That could be considered: a customer might log in to see progress of a project they commissioned (like a house renovation progress, with photos in tasks). But enabling that requires careful scoping.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Project:** Fields - Project Name, Customer (if any), Status, % Complete (calculated), Start Date, End Date, Project Manager (owner of project), Budgeted Cost/Hours, and possibly a description or scope statement.
- **Task:** Fields - Task Name, Description, Project (link), Assigned To, Status, Start and Due Date, Priority, Depends On (link to another task), and maybe field for actual hours spent vs estimated hours.
- **Timesheet/Work Log:** (If using ERPNext's Timesheets, or a simplified internal log) - Fields: Task, User, Date, Hours, Work Done description. Timesheets might roll up into payroll or billing if needed.
- **Project Update/Issue:** Some systems track issues or updates separate from tasks. Possibly not needed; tasks and comments can cover it. But could have a child doctype like "Project Milestone" or "Risk/Issue" log if advanced.
- **Link to Docs:** Many documents can have a "Project" field (Sales Order, Invoice, Purchase Order, Delivery, Expense, Timesheet). That association allows filtering by project in accounts and stock movements. So the data model extends beyond just project module tables - it's integrated through links.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Projects module UI provides both list and timeline views. For each project, a **Gantt chart** view is valuable to visualize tasks against dates. In a simple mobile scenario, maybe a list sorted by due date with indentations for dependencies suffices, but a small Gantt or timeline could be shown (the Creative Tim design or similar might have such component to leverage).

There could also be a **Kanban view** for tasks by status (To Do, Doing, Done) for users who prefer that style of tracking tasks.

The Project dashboard shows key info: number of open tasks, tasks due this week, any overdue tasks. It might also show budget vs actual if financial tracking is on (e.g., "Spent R8,000 of R10,000 budget").

Task management on mobile: likely through a unified "My Tasks" view across projects. A user opens the app and sees tasks assigned to them, due dates, and can check them off or update. They can also add quick tasks if something new comes up, and assign to themselves or others.

For project managers (could be the owner or a team lead), they can adjust tasks, reassign, and comment. The ability to add comments or attachments to tasks helps share updates or photos of progress (like a completed milestone picture).

**Offline Capabilities:** Managing tasks and projects offline is feasible in terms of data (lists of tasks can be cached; new tasks or updates can queue). If someone is at a worksite with no internet, they can update task statuses or log hours, and those sync later. The main challenge offline might be the Gantt or heavy visuals - but the app can degrade gracefully to lists when offline.

All task data entered offline (e.g., marking a task complete, or adding a new task that was noticed as needed) will sync and update the project once online. If two team members offline make conflicting changes (rare in small teams), last sync might win and require manual merge (like if both change a task status differently).

Attachments (like photos) taken offline can also queue for upload when online, which is useful for evidence of work done.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Thandi runs a small construction firm that builds rural classrooms. She uses TOSS Projects to manage each building project. For a new classroom build, she creates a_ _Project_ _"Lotus Primary Classroom Block" and enters the start date (March 1) and expected completion (May 30). She lists out_ _Tasks_\*: Foundation, Walls, Roofing, Finishing, etc., each with due dates and assigns them to her foreman or subcontractors. The system displays a timeline of these tasks. As work begins, the foreman marks the "Foundation" task as started and then completed a week later, noting in comments that extra cement was needed due to soil conditions. TOSS captures the actual finish date, and Thandi sees on the Gantt that subsequent tasks (Walls) can start.

During the build, Thandi buys materials which she tags under this project in the Buying module. She also logs labor hours via timesheets (her workers' hours are recorded against tasks in the project). The project dashboard shows that 60% of tasks are done and also aggregates costs: materials + labor so far, comparing to her budget.

One task "Roofing" is dependent on "Walls" completion. If Walls get delayed, TOSS flags Roofing as at-risk of delay too. Thandi receives a notification: "Project Lotus Primary - Roofing task might miss its start date due to delay in Walls." She can then act (maybe add more workers to catch up).

By project end, Thandi has a clear record of all activities. She closes the project. Later, when bidding for another job, she can look back at this project's data to estimate time and cost (learning that foundation took extra time due to local soil - knowledge to incorporate). If needed, she could even share a summary with the school committee: e.g., timeline and expenses, demonstrating transparency and good management.\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** The AI in Projects functions like a project management assistant. It can do **timeline predictions**: based on progress and past projects, it might foresee that a project will not meet the deadline and warn proactively[\[51\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L360-L364). For example, "Task 'Walls' is 5 days behind schedule, the overall project completion is trending 1 week late." The AI could then suggest corrective actions like reallocating resources or extending work hours.

AI can also help with **effort estimation**. If a user is creating a new project similar to a past one, the system can suggest task durations or resource needs based on historical data ("Last time a similar event planning took 40 hours of work; plan for something similar"). This is especially helpful for small business owners who might not have formal project estimation skills.

For active projects, the AI monitors any **deviations**: budget overruns, scope creep (tasks being added frequently), or idle time (tasks not started days after planned start). It will nudge the project owner with simple advice: "Project X has tasks that should have started but haven't - do you need to reschedule?" or "You're 75% through time but only 50% tasks done."

Another AI aspect is **resource leveling**: if one person is assigned 10 tasks all due this week and another has few, AI can spot the overload and suggest redistributing tasks if possible.

For billing projects, AI can ensure no billable work is missed - e.g., if timesheets are logged, it can remind, "You have 10 unbilled hours for Project Y, create an invoice?" (This touches Sales module to generate an invoice for services, but AI coordinates the prompt.)

**Collaborative Network Features:** Projects might be shared across businesses for joint initiatives. For example, multiple contractors could collaborate on a single large project (like building a community center: one does plumbing, another electrical, etc.). TOSS could allow a project to have tasks assigned to different tenant users in the network (with appropriate sharing). Each business sees only the tasks relevant to them (plus maybe overall timeline if needed), and they can update progress. The central project owner (perhaps the main contractor) sees the whole picture. This fosters **multi-company project collaboration** with clear responsibility demarcation.

There's also potential for **community projects or events** planning via TOSS: say a group of local businesses plan a joint fair. They set up a project in TOSS, share it among them, assign each other tasks (one handles venue, another marketing, etc.). Everyone can view progress. It's like a shared to-do list for the event, ensuring accountability.

Additionally, network might offer **expertise sharing**: if a business is new to project management, they could use templates from others. A more experienced user could publish a project template (like "Standard Home Renovation Project Plan") with tasks and timelines, which others can copy and adapt. This raises overall project management maturity in the network.

Permission and data control: cross-tenant tasks would likely just show minimal needed info to the collaborator. If they log time or expenses, those would reflect in their own books but also update the main project metrics through event linking (maybe by summarizing completion percentage or sending cost info if needed under an agreed contract).

For example, _the community center build involves 3 companies. Each has their own TOSS tenant. The main contractor creates Project "Community Center" and invites the plumber and electrician companies to join via the network. In TOSS, behind the scenes, it creates a project stub in each of their systems or at least tasks assigned to them that appear in their task list. They update progress on plumbing and electrical tasks respectively. The main contractor's view aggregates this (plumbing 100% done, electrical 50% done). If the main contractor linked a milestone payment to electrical completion, TOSS could notify when that task hits 100%._

This way, projects spanning multiple parties can be coordinated without everyone being in the same company record, respecting the multi-tenant separation but bridging via the collaborative layer.

## HR (Human Resources & Payroll Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The HR module manages **employee information and basic HR processes** such as attendance, leave (time off), payroll, and perhaps recruitment. For small businesses, this module keeps track of the people working in the business - be it a handful of employees or part-time helpers - and automates calculations like salaries or wages, leave balances, etc. It ensures that even without a dedicated HR person, things like paying employees on time and keeping records of their leave and performance are handled systematically[\[52\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=What%20features%20are%20available%20in,the%20HR%20module%20of%20ERPNext).

**Core Workflows:**

- **Employee Records:** Create an **Employee** profile for each staff member (or even the owner for payroll purposes). This includes personal details, contact info, role/title, date of joining, salary details, etc. For a small biz, maybe just name, phone, job title, and pay rate are the main fields.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Optionally, mark daily **Attendance** for employees[\[53\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=The%20HR%20module%20in%20ERPNext,service). This could be manual (the owner ticks off who came in each day) or via an integration (biometric or simply the employee logging check-in via app if trust). For casual businesses, this might be skipped, but for those with hourly wages, it's important.
- **Leave (Vacation/Sick Days):** Manage **Leave Application** workflow[\[54\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=How%20does%20ERPNext%20track%20employee,attendance). Employees (or owner on their behalf) apply for leave specifying type (Annual leave, Sick leave, etc.) and dates. The system keeps a tally of how many days taken and remaining (if they have an allowance).
- **Payroll Processing:** Based on employee salary info, generate **Payslips** or a Payroll Entry each pay period[\[55\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=Can%20ERPNext%20handle%20payroll%20processing%3F). For example, monthly payroll: system pulls each employee's salary, adds any earnings (overtime, commissions) and deductions (loan repayment, absence without leave, etc.), calculates taxes or contributions if needed, and produces a payslip. The owner can review and finalize, then record the salary payment.
- **Expense Claims & Reimbursements:** If employees spend their own money on business expenses, they can file an **Expense Claim** (with receipts attached). The system then logs it and can add reimbursement to payroll or prompt a separate payment.
- **Recruitment (if needed):** Possibly manage **Job Openings** and **Applicants** if the business is hiring, although this might be overkill for MVP. But a simple applicant tracker can be included (ERPNext has it).
- **Performance (future maybe):** For now likely not, but could have simple **Appraisals** or at least notes on performance in the employee record.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Unique Employee ID:** Each employee should have a unique identifier (employee number). The system could generate or allow using, say, national ID as key if needed.
- **Attendance vs Leave Reconciliation:** If someone is on approved leave, system might auto-mark them as on leave on attendance record to avoid confusion. Or disallow marking present when on leave.
- **Leave Balance Check:** When approving a leave application, the system ensures the employee has enough leave days left of that type. If not, it may allow but flag as unpaid leave or require override.
- **Payroll Calculations Accuracy:** All components in payroll (like if tax calculation is needed) must follow defined formula. For example, for South Africa, it would incorporate PAYE tax tables, UIF, etc., if the user opts in. But for simplicity, initial payroll might just be gross pay and net pay if they don't handle taxes (most small micro enterprises might not unless formal).
- **Payslip Approval:** Possibly require a review step, or at least once payroll is processed, mark it as final. Prevent changes to past payroll unless via proper adjustments (for audit trail).
- **Confidentiality:** Salary info should be restricted to authorized roles (owner, maybe accountant). TOSS should ensure that normal employees using the app cannot see other's salaries or HR data (row-level permission by employee).
- **Statutory Compliance:** If configured, ensure calculations like provident fund or tax are in line with rules. Could also include auto-generation of payslip slips or statutory reports (like UIF declarations if needed).
- **Contract End Alerts:** If an employee is on contract with an end date, system can alert HR a month before expiry to decide renewal or termination.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Employee:** Fields - Name, Employee ID, Date of Joining, Department/Designation (if any), Salary info (could be structured as components: basic, allowances, etc., or simply a rate), Pay Frequency (monthly, weekly), Leave allocation (like 15 annual leave days/year), Status (Active/Left), maybe Bank account for salary transfer.
- **Attendance:** Fields - Employee, Date, Status (Present, Absent, Half Day, etc.), maybe check-in/out times if needed.
- **Leave Type:** Master specifying types (Annual Paid Leave, Sick Leave, etc.) and rules (like whether it accrues, whether encashable).
- **Leave Allocation:** For each employee, how many days of each leave type they get (yearly or total). Alternatively, could compute based on joining date and policy.
- **Leave Application:** Fields - Employee, Leave Type, From date, To date, Reason, Status (Applied, Approved, Rejected).
- **Salary Structure/Payslip:** ERPNext has Salary Structure (template of earning/deduction components) and Payslip which is actual for the period. Simplified approach: a payslip per employee per pay period listing Gross, Deductions, Net. Fields - Employee, Period (month), components (like Base Salary, Overtime, Tax, etc.), Net Pay, and whether paid.
- **Payroll Entry:** A batch entity representing a payroll run for a period. It can have all payslips under it for approval.
- **Expense Claim:** Fields - Employee, date, details of expenses (child table of expense items with amount, description), total, approved/rejected, and whether reimbursed (could link to a Payment entry or payslip).
- **Company (HR Settings):** Could hold general settings like standard work hours, holiday list (public holidays), etc.

**User Interface & Experience:** The HR module UI, for a small business, should be straightforward:

- **Employee Directory:** a simple list of employees with maybe photo, name, position, contact. Adding an employee is via a form with personal and job details.
- **Attendance marking:** Possibly a daily view where the owner can tick checkboxes for who's present. Or employees can mark themselves via the app if allowed (with maybe a PIN or something to avoid buddy punching).
- **Leave:** A screen showing each employee's leave balances and a quick way to apply for leave. If an employee uses the app, they can fill a leave form which sends to owner for approval (owner gets a notification and just taps approve or reject). The leave calendar can show upcoming time off so the owner knows who's out when.
- **Payroll:** A wizard or step-by-step for payroll each month. Step 1: pick month and employees (likely all active by default). Step 2: system generates draft payslips with base salary and any automatic deductions. Step 3: owner can edit any variable parts (e.g., add overtime hours or a bonus). Step 4: finalize and mark as paid. After finalizing, payslips can be viewed (and possibly printed or shared individually with employees).
- The UI for a payslip should show the breakdown: "Base Pay: R X, Overtime: R Y, Total Earnings: R Z. Deductions: Tax: R A, Other: R B, Total Deductions: R C. **Net Pay: R (Z-C)**."
- **Notifications:** The module will produce notifications like "Alice has applied for 2 days leave (Mar 5-6) for 'Medical'. Approve?" where the owner can click Approve right from notification if possible.
- **Self-Service:** If employees have limited access, they might be allowed to see their own payslips, apply for leave, and check their remaining leave days via the app (but not see others').
- Possibly a **Team Calendar** combining both schedule tasks (if Projects to person) and leave, so the owner sees who is available.

**Offline Capabilities:** HR functions like attendance and leave can be recorded offline if needed. For example, if the store is offline in the morning, the owner can still tick attendance; it will sync later with date/time stamps. Employees applying for leave offline can fill the form which queues up. The risk is if two offline devices both mark attendance for the same person differently (like one says present, one says absent), but typically one person (owner/manager) would handle attendance to avoid conflict.

Payslip generation likely would be done while online since it might need up-to-date tax rules or ensure all data is current, but in principle, a draft could be generated offline using cached data and sync calculations later. Payment disbursement might be recorded offline too (like note that salaries were paid in cash on a date, then sync).

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Amina owns a tailoring shop with 3 employees. She uses TOSS HR to keep things organized. In the Employee section, she has profiles for her tailors with their start dates and salaries. Each morning, when the team arrives, Amina opens the Attendance page on her phone and marks everyone present (if someone is out sick, she marks Absent and the system will treat it accordingly). Last month, one employee, Sam, joined mid-month. TOSS automatically pro-rated his first salary.

One of her employees, Lerato, wants two days off next week for a family event. Lerato opens her TOSS app (with employee login) and submits a **Leave Application** for those days under "Annual Leave". Amina immediately gets an alert in her app: "Lerato requests Annual Leave from Sep 10 to Sep 11." Amina checks the schedule and approves it with one tap. TOSS deducts 2 days from Lerato's leave balance and marks those dates so Amina knows she'll be short-staffed then.

At the end of the month, Amina runs **Payroll**. She starts a Payroll Entry for the month. TOSS pulls each employee's salary: e.g., Lerato R3000, Sam R2500, Thabo R3000. Lerato took 2 leave days but she had enough leave balance, so it's paid leave (her salary remains full). Sam had one unpaid absence (was sick but no leave balance as he's new), so the system deducted one day's pay (R125) from his salary automatically. Amina reviews these on each draft payslip. Everything looks fine; she confirms and finalizes payroll. The app then marks those payslips as final. She records that she paid them in cash - each employee will sign a receipt outside the system. In TOSS, she just marks each payslip as Paid (maybe via a Bulk "Mark Paid").

Each employee can now see their **Payslip** on their phone - a simple breakdown so they understand how their pay was calculated (Sam sees one day deduction, which matches what Amina told him). This builds trust as everything is transparent and accurate[\[55\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=Can%20ERPNext%20handle%20payroll%20processing%3F).

Next, Amina also uses HR to track a loan she gave Thabo. She put it as a recurring deduction of R100 each month on his profile. The payslip reflected that deduction. After a few months, once fully deducted, she'll remove that deduction entry.

Finally, Amina's shop occasionally brings interns on stipends. She uses the employee records to note contract end dates. The system will remind her when an intern's contract is close to ending so she can decide on extension or prepare a parting certificate.\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** The AI in HR can act like an HR advisor. For example, it monitors attendance patterns and might alert Amina: "Notice: Thabo has been late 3 times this week" or "Lerato has used 80% of her annual leave already, plan accordingly." It can also watch labor cost vs sales - "Your labor cost was 20% of sales this month, up from 15% last month[\[56\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L26-L34)." Such insight helps to ensure staffing levels are right. If integrated with scheduling (maybe via Projects or tasks), it could suggest optimizing shifts ("Fridays are busiest, ensure all staff are present or consider extra help").

For performance, if Amina does any ratings or the system infers from project task completions, AI could identify top performers or training needs ("Sam consistently finishes tasks 20% faster than estimated" or "Thabo seems to struggle with complex alterations - consider training").

For compliance, AI can remind of statutory things: "Remember to submit UIF form by 7th" (if relevant to those on payroll) or "It's time to review salaries, inflation was X% this year" as a gentle nudge for raises.

**Collaborative Network Features:** HR data is usually private, but some collaborative ideas: - **Shared Talent Pool:** Within a network, businesses could share a pool of pre-vetted temporary workers. TOSS could allow an employee (especially contractors or temp staff) to be "shared" across tenants. For instance, a driver might do deliveries for multiple shops. If the network has a feature for gig workers, a driver could have a profile visible to nearby businesses and they can log hours for him. Each business might pay him separately, but his single profile accumulates his experience. - **Group Benefits:** A network could negotiate group health insurance or similar for members' employees. TOSS could assist by providing aggregated employee counts, ages, etc., without personal details, to insurance providers, then help manage contributions if one is set up (like a deduction in payroll for insurance premium for those employees who opt in). - **Training events:** If a skill workshop is organized for the network's employees (say a customer service training), it can be managed as a project and HR link by marking which employees from which companies attended. So cross-tenant events and tracking can be done. - **Compliance help:** Possibly the network might collectively ensure labor law compliance (like everyone paying at least minimum wage, etc.). TOSS could alert if any salary is below known minimum wage law (if data is input). That might be more a core feature than network, but a network could share best practices and TOSS enforces them if the group decides (like all cooperative members must give 12 days leave - configured in system for all).

Primarily though, HR is internal. The collaborative aspects might come in for sharing resources (like a traveling expert that works short stints at different places, handled via timesheets across tenants) and collective welfare (using data to help all employees get something like easier access to loans - e.g., a microfinance might look at aggregated employment data via TOSS to lend to employees).

For example, _if an employee of one shop applies for a personal loan with a bank that's partnering with the TOSS network, with the employee's consent, TOSS could share their employment and income verification digitally (like how large companies provide employment letters). The network's credibility could make banks more comfortable lending to these individuals._ This isn't exactly HR collaboration between businesses, but leveraging the network for employee benefit.

## Support (Customer Support & Service Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Support module (Helpdesk) is designed to handle **customer issues, complaints, or service requests**. It ensures that when customers of the business have problems - say a product defect, a question, or a need for service - those issues are logged, tracked, and resolved efficiently[\[57\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,manage%20tickets%20by%20connecting%20your). For small businesses, this could be as simple as noting down customer complaints and making sure each is addressed (e.g., exchanging a damaged product, scheduling a service call, or answering an inquiry). It also covers **maintenance** and **warranty** management for businesses dealing with equipment (either their own or customer-owned assets that need servicing)[\[58\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/maintenance#:~:text=The%20maintenance%20schedule%20and%20maintenance,optimized%20ERP%20environment%20for%20users). The aim is to not let customer requests fall through the cracks and to maintain a good reputation through responsive support.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Issue/Ticket Logging:** When a customer contacts the business with a problem or request, create a **Support Issue (Ticket)** in TOSS[\[57\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,manage%20tickets%20by%20connecting%20your). Fields capture the customer, date, and description of the issue. Issues could come via email (if integrated), via the website (a form), or manually by staff entering details from a phone call or walk-in.
- **Issue Assignment & Prioritization:** Categorize the issue (e.g., Inquiry, Complaint, Technical Fault) and set a priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent). Assign it to a team member or the person responsible for resolving it[\[59\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,how%20happy%20the%20customers%20are). For example, a technician might be assigned to fix an appliance under warranty.
- **Response & Resolution:** Communicate with the customer as needed - the module logs these communications (could integrate with email or WhatsApp). Staff add **Status updates** to the ticket: e.g., "In Progress - part ordered," then "Resolved - part replaced." All interactions (emails sent, calls made notes) can be recorded on the ticket timeline[\[57\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,manage%20tickets%20by%20connecting%20your).
- **SLA Management:** If Service Level Agreements (promised response times) are defined, the system monitors them[\[60\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,that%20have%20already%20been%20set). For instance, "respond to all complaints within 24h". The system will flag or escalate if an issue hasn't been responded to or resolved in the agreed time.
- **Closure & Feedback:** Once the issue is resolved to the customer's satisfaction, close the ticket. Optionally, capture customer feedback or a satisfaction level.
- **Maintenance Schedules:** For businesses that maintain equipment (like a shop might maintain its freezer or a co-op might share a generator), schedule **Maintenance Visits** using this module[\[58\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/maintenance#:~:text=The%20maintenance%20schedule%20and%20maintenance,optimized%20ERP%20environment%20for%20users). E.g., quarterly service of a machine - create a maintenance schedule and TOSS will spawn issues or tasks when service is due.
- **Warranty Claims:** If a sold product is under warranty and fails, log it as an issue with tag "Warranty." The system can track if it gets repaired, replaced, or if a claim must be sent to the supplier.
- **Knowledge Base:** Over time, collect common solutions in a **Knowledge Base** so that similar issues can be solved faster[\[61\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,tickets%20by%20connecting%20your%20email). E.g., an FAQ or troubleshooting guide accessible to staff (or even customers via website).

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Unique Ticket ID:** Each issue gets an ID for tracking (for example, SUP-0001). This ID can be shared with customer so they can refer to it.
- **Mandatory Details:** At least a contact (customer or name/phone) and issue description should be required to log a ticket, so nothing is too vague or orphaned.
- **SLA Timer:** If using SLAs, the system automatically sets deadlines (like must respond by X, resolve by Y based on priority) and escalates if not met. Escalation might mean notifying a manager or raising priority.
- **Ticket Status Flow:** Typically New → Open (assigned) → Work in Progress → Resolved/Pending Confirmation → Closed. The system might restrict certain transitions (e.g., can't close without marking resolved). If a customer says it's not solved, perhaps reopen.
- **Customer Portal Access:** If enabled, a customer could view their tickets on a portal and even open new ones. The system would validate their identity. But probably for MVP, support staff handle all entries.
- **Integration with Sales/Stock:** If a support issue results in a replacement product being issued, ideally that should link to a Delivery (stock out) or Sales Return. Business rule: any free replacement item should be recorded in inventory and perhaps tied to the original sale invoice (for warranty validation). Not enforced by support module itself, but procedure to ensure consistency.
- **Knowledge Base Updates:** Some places enforce that if an issue is of a certain type and resolved, a knowledge base entry is created or updated. We might not enforce, but encourage with UI prompts like "Document this solution in Knowledge Base?".

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Issue/Ticket:** Fields - Issue ID, Subject, Description, Customer (or just a contact name/phone for walk-ins not in system), Issue Type/Category, Priority, Status, Opening Date, Response Due Date (if SLA), Resolve Due Date, Assigned To, Resolution Summary, and links (like to an Item or Sales Invoice if relevant).
- **Issue Comment/Communication:** Possibly using the system's communication log or comments to record messages related to the issue (including automated emails).
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** Could be a doctype defining for a given priority or contract, the response and resolution targets.
- **Maintenance Schedule:** Fields - Asset or Item to maintain, schedule frequency (e.g., monthly, or specific dates), next due date. It can auto-create **Maintenance Visit** records when due.
- **Maintenance Visit/Log:** Fields - what was done, any parts used, technician, status (completed or needs follow-up).
- **Warranty Claim:** If separate, fields - Item, serial/batch (if any), issue description, verdict (approved/denied), action (repaired, replaced), and link to any supplier RMA if outwards.
- **Knowledge Base (Solution or Help Article):** Fields - title, issue symptoms, solution steps. Possibly link to related Issue or Item. Could be exposed on website or internal.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Support dashboard would show open tickets, possibly in order of priority or due date. It might have counters: "Open: 5, Overdue: 1, Awaiting Customer: 2, Total closed this month: 20" etc. A support agent (or the owner wearing that hat) can filter by status or assignee.

Logging a new issue is straightforward: perhaps a big "+ New Ticket" button, which on mobile just asks "Customer Name/Phone, Issue details" and optionally pick a type like "Product Issue / General Query". If the customer exists in CRM, selecting them could auto-fill contact details and show their purchase history (to pick which product has an issue, perhaps).

On each issue, conversation history is shown, like a thread or chat. The support person can add a note like "We will send a technician tomorrow" and mark status accordingly. If email integration is set, they could press "Reply to customer" and it would send an email (but maybe out of MVP scope; they might just call or SMS in reality, then note in system "Called customer, advised on solution").

For maintenance schedules, perhaps an interface like a calendar or list of upcoming services. The system might generate tasks or tickets for each upcoming maintenance, which appear like normal issues but internally flagged as maintenance type.

For warranty, when creating a ticket, if user selects an item that is under warranty (maybe by serial number lookup), the system could flag "Item under warranty until \[date\]" to guide how to handle (maybe free replacement).

**Offline Capabilities:** Field technicians or support staff might use the app offline when visiting a customer site. They should be able to pull up the ticket details offline (assuming it was synced beforehand) and update it (like adding resolution notes or changing status to Completed) while out of coverage, then sync later. If creating a new ticket offline (say someone complains at a remote location), it's stored and will be uploaded.

The knowledge base would likely not be accessible offline unless cached, but we might cache some frequent solutions for offline reference.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Joseph sells and services solar lamps. A customer, Mary, comes back with a lamp that isn't charging. Joseph opens the Support module on TOSS and logs a_ _Ticket_\*: "Lamp not charging", selects Mary's name from customers (or enters her contacts), and chooses category "Product Warranty". TOSS knows that lamp was sold 3 months ago with 1-year warranty (because the sales invoice and item info are linked), so it flags it as "Under Warranty". Joseph assigns the ticket to his technician, Alan.

Alan gets the ticket on his app, sees Mary's address and the issue. He goes to check the lamp. Offline at Mary's place, he opens the app to view the issue details (which were synced earlier). He finds the solar panel connection loose, fixes it on the spot. On the ticket, he adds a **Comment** "Reattached panel wires, lamp charging now" and sets status to Resolved. Mary is happy.

When Alan is back online, the ticket updates to server. Joseph sees it on his dashboard as Resolved. He calls Mary to confirm everything is fine, then closes the ticket. The system tracks that from open to close it took 2 days.

Another scenario: separately, Joseph has a fridge in his shop that needs yearly service. He entered a **Maintenance Schedule** for "Shop Fridge" to service every 12 months. TOSS reminds him a month before due via a generated maintenance ticket: "Service Shop Fridge due." He uses that prompt to schedule a technician visit for preventative maintenance. Once done, he closes that with notes "Cleaned coils, checked coolant".

For common issues, Joseph also starts building a **Knowledge Base**. For example, he got many questions about how to change the lamp battery. He writes a quick help article "How to replace solar lamp battery" in TOSS Solutions. Next time someone calls, he can refer to it, or even send them a link if the knowledge base is available on his website.

Because Joseph cares about service, he set an **SLA**: respond to all support tickets within 4 working hours. One day he misses a notification and 5 hours pass with no reply to a new ticket. TOSS flags it as breached SLA (maybe turning it red and bumping priority). Joseph then quickly calls the customer to apologize and assist, learning to keep a closer eye on those alerts.\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** The AI in Support can help triage and even suggest solutions. For instance, if Mary's "lamp not charging" issue is logged, the AI could search the knowledge base and pop a suggestion: "Solution found: Check solar panel wire (common issue)" - essentially an AI-driven FAQ helper[\[61\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,tickets%20by%20connecting%20your%20email). This reduces time to resolution by guiding support staff to known fixes. If integrated with some NLP, it might categorize tickets by analyzing the description (e.g., categorize as "charging issue" vs "bulb issue").

It might also prioritize tickets based on sentiment or impact. For example, it could detect if certain keywords indicate an urgent or potentially viral complaint (like "battery exploded") and mark it high priority automatically.

AI can also analyze support trends: "In the past month, 5 tickets about lamp model X not charging - maybe a batch problem or design flaw."[\[51\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L360-L364) This insight can prompt Joseph to check that product line or inform the supplier.

For customer happiness, AI might track average resolution time and compare to satisfaction feedback. It could suggest improvements if certain issue types take too long (e.g., "Delivery delay complaints average 4 days to resolve; consider a faster process").

If multiple support agents, AI can load-balance by suggesting who should take a new ticket (based on workload or expertise).

**Collaborative Network Features:** Support collaboration across businesses might occur if multiple companies share a customer support center or escalate issues to each other. Example: A small IT support co-op where each member handles first-level support for their own clients but can escalate complex issues to a central expert group. TOSS could allow transferring a ticket to another tenant in the network (with the customer's okay presumably). The receiving party then handles it and maybe charges for it (the system could tie into inter-company billing if needed).

Another angle: if one business's product is supported by another (like a retailer logs warranty claims to the manufacturer), TOSS can facilitate creating a linked issue in the manufacturer's system. Essentially, the retailer's ticket marked as "Escalated to Supplier" can spawn an issue in the supplier's TOSS instance via network. The supplier resolves it (maybe by sending replacement), updates their issue, which then syncs back a status update to the retailer's ticket. This supply chain support integration is powerful for quick turnaround[\[48\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L430-L438).

Also, knowledge base could be shared network-wide. E.g., common troubleshooting for a device might be maintained by the manufacturer and available to all resellers' support modules. TOSS can allow certain knowledge base articles to be syndicated across tenants (so everyone gives correct info). Possibly a network support forum integration too.

Group SLAs might be established for network-driven services (like a driver co-op might promise any delivery issue is addressed within X hours by whomever is responsible). TOSS then monitors those and can show a network SLA compliance report.

In summary, the Support module primarily ensures each business handles its customer issues well, but via the network it can escalate problems to those accountable upstream (suppliers) or share expertise sideways (other similar businesses). This collective approach means a small shop is not alone in solving product issues - it has the backing of a network's knowledge and the manufacturer's direct input through the integrated system. This leads to faster resolutions and better customer service overall[\[60\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,that%20have%20already%20been%20set).

## POS (Point of Sale Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The POS module provides a streamlined interface for **selling products in a retail setting**, particularly optimized for counter sales and **offline functionality**[\[62\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L190-L198)[\[63\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L208-L216). It's essentially the front-end for daily sales at a shop, enabling quick billing, multiple payment modes, and receipt printing. The key goal is to make selling fast and possible without internet, syncing transactions later to the main system. This module is critical for high-volume or quick transactions, like in grocery stores, clothing shops, food stalls, etc., common in townships.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Sale Transaction Entry:** The cashier uses the POS screen to build a **cart** of items a customer is buying. They scan item barcodes or search by name, adjust quantities, and the system calculates totals with taxes/discounts if any. It's akin to creating an invoice but in a more interactive manner.
- **Multiple Payment Methods:** The customer can pay via cash, card, mobile money, or split among these. The POS module allows recording one or more payment modes per order (e.g., R50 cash, R30 card)[\[64\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L194-L202). It should also handle situations like giving change for cash.
- **Receipt Printing:** After payment, a sales receipt can be printed or sent via SMS/WhatsApp to the customer (if technology permits). The receipt shows item details, prices, total, payments, and shop info.
- **Sales Syncing:** Each sale will create a Sales Invoice or similar record in the backend. If offline, these are queued. Once online, the transactions sync to the server, updating central accounts and stock[\[65\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L200-L205).
- **Closing Day/Shift:** At day end or shift end, the cashier can do a **Cash-Up** process: the system shows how much cash should be in drawer based on sales, the cashier counts actual cash, enters it, and the system records any variance[\[19\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L234-L241). This ensures accountability and feeds into accounting.
- **Returns/Refunds:** The POS should handle simple returns or exchanges. Either by referencing the original receipt (if stored) or just doing a negative line sale. For instance, a customer returns an item bought earlier; the cashier can mark it and either give refund or allow exchange with something else.
- **Hold/Resume (optional):** In case a customer isn't done and steps aside, the cashier can hold the bill and start a new one for the next in line, then recall the held one later.
- **User Authentication:** Each cashier likely logs in with a PIN or credentials to use POS. This logs who did the sale (important for shift tracking).
- **POS Settings:** Some config like default warehouse (stock source), whether to allow sale when out-of-stock, etc., would be set per POS profile.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Stock Deduction:** The POS will reserve/deduct stock as soon as sale is completed (or when syncing). If an item is out-of-stock (and system knows it, when online), the system might warn or prevent adding it. If offline, it may allow sale but later sync might show negative stock, then management must adjust. Config might allow or block negative stock sales.
- **Pricing Accuracy:** The POS uses the price list (likely standard selling rate) and applies any tax included. It must ensure correct calculation even offline (so price list and tax rules must be cached). If a cashier tries to change a price manually (if allowed), system should log it or require a manager override if beyond allowed discount.
- **Payment Completion:** Should not finalize a sale until the payment collected equals or exceeds total (unless it's a credit sale by design, but in POS typically you settle immediately). Overpayments could be handled by issuing change. If card payment fails, allow reattempt or alternate method.
- **Receipt Sequence:** Each sale gets a unique POS invoice number (maybe separate series from regular invoices). If offline, it might number them locally, then on sync might adjust or map to a central sequence or keep the offline as a distinct series labeled by device.
- **Security:** Cashier should not be able to access more than needed (e.g., not deep accounting data). Also, once a sale is made, editing it should be restricted (returns via new transactions, not altering old ones).
- **End-of-Day Variance:** If a large variance is noted repeatedly, system may alert management (could tie into AI or at least logs these events).
- **Offline Limits:** Possibly set a limit on how many offline invoices can be made or how long to go without sync, to avoid huge backlog or misuse. But in practice, if days offline, it should accumulate and sync when possible.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **POS Profile/Settings:** Fields - link to specific Store or user, default Warehouse, default Cash account, allowed payment modes, etc. If multiple devices or branches, each might have one.
- **POS Invoice (Sales Invoice variant):** Fields - Invoice ID, date/time, items (item code, qty, price, amount), taxes, total, list of payments (mode, amount), cashier, and perhaps a link to a customer if captured (often sales are to "Walk-in" generic customer unless specifically recording).
- **POS Payment Entry (maybe embedded):** Each invoice has payments, or the invoice itself holds the multi-payment details.
- **Sales Invoice (regular):** Possibly the POS uses the same doctype as normal Sales Invoice but flagged as POS, or it has a separate queue that later creates Sales Invoices on sync.
- **Closing Voucher/Cashup record:** Could be a doctype that logs closing counts: fields - cashier, period (shift), expected cash, actual cash, variance, and remarks. This might trigger an accounting entry if needed to record any over/short.
- **POS Log/Sync Log:** internal tracking of what's synced, last sync timestamp, etc.

**User Interface & Experience:** The POS UI is distinct from the rest of the back-office. It's typically a full-screen interface with large buttons and minimal text input:

- **Item selection:** If device has a barcode scanner (or camera scan), scanning item instantly adds it to cart. Otherwise, a big search bar or category buttons allow adding items.
- **Cart view:** The right (or left) side shows the list of items chosen, with quantity and price, live-updating total. Each line can be tapped to edit quantity or remove.
- **On-Screen Keypad:** For touchscreen devices, an on-screen numeric keypad to enter custom quantities or prices.
- **Payment:** When cart is final, clicking "Pay" opens a payment modal: shows total, options for cash, card, etc., likely with quick buttons for common amounts to quickly calculate change (e.g., if total is R78 and customer gives R100, cashier enters 100 cash, system shows change R22).
- **Offline indicator:** Perhaps a small status icon showing if the device is offline (so cashier knows to inform customer maybe receipts might not be emailed or something).
- **Customer info:** Optionally capture customer phone or name for receipt (not mandatory for quick sales, but helpful for warranty or loyalty if integrated).
- **Print/Done:** After payment, a "Print Receipt" (if printer connected) or "Send Receipt" action. Then POS resets to new sale.

The UI needs to be **fast** - minimal loading delays - because customers are waiting. Data like item list and prices are preloaded/cached to avoid any fetch delay mid-sale. If an item has variations (size, color) maybe a quick selection popup appears.

Mobile-first: Many might run POS on a tablet or even smartphone. The design should be responsive - maybe simpler on a small screen (vertical scrolling list of items to tap-add, etc.). If a dedicated device, maybe small Android tablets with barcode scanners or those all-in-one POS devices.

**Offline Capabilities:** The POS is specifically built for offline. It stores a local copy of all items, prices, taxes, and even last known stock (if needed but not critical for selling). When offline, it continues to generate sales and numbers them locally. It will queue these sales in a local database. When connectivity is restored, it automatically pushes those to the server (ensuring unique ID mapping, maybe using a device prefix or a temporary series then server consolidates them).

During offline, some features might be limited: e.g., if paying by card, that might need internet (unless it's a separate card terminal outside TOSS's scope). But cash transactions are fine offline. If it's integrated with any online loyalty or validation (like gift cards), those might not work offline unless pre-validated data is cached.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Sibongile operates a busy spaza shop. She uses TOSS POS on an affordable Android tablet with a built-in scanner. Each morning, she opens the POS app and it syncs to ensure prices and stock are up-to-date. Mid-morning, the internet goes down, but she continues selling seamlessly.

A customer comes with 5 items: bread, milk, 2 soda cans, and chips. Sibongile scans each item's barcode; each beep adds the item to the list with price. The POS instantly shows the running total and any tax included (VAT is included in prices in her case). The customer has an old phone number she gave previously, Sibongile finds her in system as a regular; she decides to tag the sale to that customer to track their purchase history (maybe for loyalty points in future). The total is R96. Customer pays R100 cash. Sibongile hits "Cash", enters 100. The POS shows "Change: R4.00". She finalizes the sale, the app prints a small receipt on her Bluetooth printer. All this while offline - the customer experience is uninterrupted.

By afternoon, connectivity returns; the POS syncs all morning sales (maybe 50 transactions) to the server in the background. Inventory is reduced for each item sold, and accounting entries for daily sales aggregate into the books[\[66\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L222-L225).

Later in the day, a customer returns a pack of spoiled bread from the morning sale. Sibongile finds the receipt or the record in POS (or just trusts the customer since it's a small amount) - she uses the POS "Return Item" function: scans the bread, it shows -R12 (negative line) and processes a refund of R12 in cash. This updates inventory (one bread added back, or marked wasted if she chooses not to resell it) and logs the return.

At 7 PM, she closes the shop. The POS has a **Close Shift** routine: it shows total cash sales R800, card sales R500 for the day. Sibongile counts the cash in drawer - it's R790, R10 short. She enters actual cash R790. The system records a R10 shortfall variance[\[67\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L232-L239). She notes maybe she gave a bit extra change by mistake. This closing entry, once synced, will adjust the accounting (record that R10 as a cash short expense).

Throughout, the interface was easy: large text, simple steps. She could operate it while chatting with customers, improving speed and reducing errors. If something wasn't in the system (say a new product not entered yet), she could use a generic PLU or quickly add it at checkout with a price - the system would mark it as an open item sale (to be properly added to inventory later by management).

Thanks to POS, Sibongile can also see later which items sold most (through reports), and that data feeds into Stock module reorders, and her AI co-pilot might suggest "You sold 50 sodas today (fast mover), ensure to restock soon!"\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** AI in POS can provide smart prompts: for example, **upselling** suggestions[\[68\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L238-L241). If common combos exist (like customers who buy bread often also buy butter), the POS could alert "Suggest butter?" when bread is in cart and butter stock is available. This could increase sales per transaction.

AI also monitors **patterns**: e.g., detects if a certain time of day has peak load - it might recommend "Peak at 6-7pm, ensure two cashiers if possible." Or if certain products often cause checkout delays (maybe due to needing age verification or price lookup), it could highlight improving that.

For cash management, AI will track variances: "You have had a cash shortfall 3 days this week averaging R5. Check for error or theft patterns[\[19\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L234-L241)." If a particular cashier always has a shortage, it might discretely flag that trend.

**Sales analytics** from POS feed the AI too: daily, weekly trends, identifying top sellers, slow movers (coupling with Stock info) for the owner's dashboard, as well as detecting anomalies (e.g., "Today's sales unusually low compared to average Wednesday - was the weather bad or a competitor promotion?").

Also, AI can handle **loyalty** if implemented: e.g., "Customer X has spent R1000 here so far - consider offering a loyalty reward." Or identify new vs returning customers counts.

**Collaborative Network Features:** POS is typically local to each store, but network collaboration could come in forms of:

- **Multi-Store Data Sharing:** If one business has multiple outlets, all POS data consolidates to the central server (within same tenant). If separate businesses want to compare or share best practices, they might share aggregated metrics. Possibly a network dashboard could show average sales per store across a cooperative.
- **Unified Marketplace Integration:** If the network runs an online marketplace or group delivery system, POS could feed into it or vice versa. For example, a network might allow customers to order online from multiple shops; those orders come into each shop's POS queue for picking up or delivery packaging.
- **Cross-Store Sales:** Not common for POS, but maybe if a shop runs out of something, they could issue a sale from a neighbor's inventory (with permission). This would be more of a stock transfer sale as discussed in Stock/Collaboration.
- **Shared POS resources:** Perhaps a mobile POS that travels (like a network-hired card machine used by many small vendors on rotation). The network might have a pool of devices given to members for events - then those sales might be tagged by business and separated in the system. This is an edge case, but interesting for cooperatives at markets.

Primarily, network benefits come from combining POS data: e.g., negotiating better deals with suppliers by showing collective sales volumes. TOSS could help generate a combined sales report (if businesses agree to share that data) showing, say, total cola sales across 50 spaza shops, which they use to ask Coca-Cola for a bulk discount.

Another angle: enabling **group loyalty programs** where customers earn/redeem points across a network of shops. The POS systems across the network would need to recognize a shared loyalty account. That requires network data exchange: e.g., a central loyalty service that each POS consults (which could be TOSS's network layer hosting a multi-tenant loyalty ledger). So a customer can earn points at Shop A and spend at Shop B. Each POS call updates the central points. This fosters customer retention within the network.

In summary, the POS module directly empowers day-to-day sales especially offline. In conjunction with the network, it can elevate a local shop's capabilities to those approaching a chain, via collective analytics, shared customer programs, and supply chain leverage[\[69\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L228-L236).

## Assets (Asset Management Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Assets module is for tracking **fixed assets** owned by the business - things like equipment, machinery, vehicles, computers, furniture - basically any valuable item that has a long life and possibly depreciation. It helps keep a register of these assets, monitor their value depreciation over time for accounting, schedule maintenance, and eventually manage disposals[\[52\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=What%20features%20are%20available%20in,the%20HR%20module%20of%20ERPNext)[\[70\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=4). For township businesses, assets could include things like fridges, ovens, vehicles, solar panels, etc., which might also be provided by suppliers (like a beverage fridge from Coke). Managing these is important to ensure they are maintained and properly accounted for.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Asset Registration:** When the business acquires a new asset (purchase or donation), create an **Asset record** for it. Capture details like purchase date, cost, serial number, warranty period, supplier, etc. Assign it an ID or code. Categorize it (vehicle, appliance, IT equipment, etc.).
- **Depreciation Schedule:** Based on asset type and expected life, the system generates a **Depreciation schedule** - typically monthly or yearly depreciation entries that reduce its book value[\[52\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=What%20features%20are%20available%20in,the%20HR%20module%20of%20ERPNext). E.g., a laptop costing R12k might depreciate R200 a month over 5 years. The module can auto-post these depreciation expenses periodically.
- **Asset Value & Accounting:** The asset has an original value, current book value (after depreciation), and salvage value (expected at end). The system ensures depreciation entries hit the right accounts (debit depreciation expense, credit accumulated depreciation).
- **Maintenance & Repair Tracking:** Link with Support/Maintenance - schedule regular maintenance for assets (like service generator every 6 months), which the Support module handles (maintenance schedules & visits). Also, if an asset breaks and is repaired, log that event under the asset (with cost if any).
- **Movement/Location Tracking:** If assets can move or are assigned to people, record the **location or custodian**. E.g., "Laptop #3 assigned to employee John" or "Generator moved to Village Center site". This way, you know who is responsible for it.
- **Asset Disposal:** When an asset is sold off or scrapped, process a **Disposal**. This could create accounting entries to remove it from books (gain/loss on disposal if sold different from book value) and mark asset as retired.
- **Asset Reporting:** Provide an asset register (list of all assets with values), depreciation summary, and maybe maintenance cost per asset.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Unique Identification:** Each asset gets a unique code or tag. If physical tagging, maybe you input that code.
- **Depreciation rules:** Should follow chosen method (likely straight-line by default). The system ensures you don't depreciate past salvage or after its useful life. If purchase date mid-year, it prorates first period appropriately.
- **No Duplicate Depreciation:** If an asset's depreciation for a period is already posted, prevent posting again (or allow rollback).
- **Value Consistency:** The sum of depreciation posted plus current book value should equal original cost (less any impairment adjustments). The system should auto-calc and enforce that math.
- **Useful Life & Rate:** Need either life in years or depreciation rate (like 20% a year). Validate that input. Also salvage value must be <= cost, obviously.
- **Link to Accounting:** Each asset category might map to specific accounts (asset account, depreciation expense account). The system ensures depreciation entries use those. Possibly defined in asset category or in settings.
- **Asset State:** Only active (in-use) assets depreciate. If you pause usage (like store away), maybe still depreciate if you own it. After disposal, no further depreciation. The system stops depreciation after disposal date.
- **Maintenance Log:** Ensure any maintenance actions feed into the asset's history. If an asset is under warranty, maybe flag if trying to do a paid repair that could have been claimed.
- **Access Control:** Perhaps only managers can add/dispose assets, since it affects financials.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Asset:** Fields - Asset Name, Category (type), Purchase Date, Purchase Cost, Supplier, Serial/IMEI/etc, Assigned To (employee or department), Location, Warranty Expiry, Expected Life (or rate), Salvage Value, Depreciation Start Date, Depreciation Method, Accumulated Depreciation (computed), Current Value (computed), Status (Active, Under Maintenance, Disposed).
- **Asset Category:** Could hold default accounts and default depreciation rate/life for each category (e.g., Electronics 3 years, Furniture 5 years).
- **Depreciation Ledger/Entry:** Possibly each scheduled posting as its own doctype or the asset doctype may generate accounting entries directly. ERPNext typically creates an "Asset Depreciation Ledger" with schedule and posts Journal Entries. Fields - Asset, Date, Amount, Journal Entry link when posted.
- **Asset Value Adjustment:** If any revaluation or impairment is done (increase or write-down of value), record that. But likely out-of-scope for MVP unless needed.
- **Asset Maintenance Log:** Could just be a link to Maintenance tickets from Support. Or an internal table for each asset listing maintenance done (date, type, cost).
- **Asset Movement:** A simple child record when changing assignment/location: fields - date, from, to, person who did it.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Asset module might be used less frequently, but it should present:

- **Asset Register:** a table of all assets with key info: code, name, purchase date, cost, current value, status, location, person responsible.
- **Asset Detail Page:** shows full info and maybe quick links to related records (like open maintenance tickets for it, depreciation schedule).
- Perhaps a graph of depreciation remaining vs life (nice visual of how much value left).
- **New Asset Form:** includes financial details. Possibly integrate with Buying: e.g., when booking a Purchase Invoice for an equipment, allow "create asset from this line" which auto-fills cost and supplier.
- **Depreciation Schedule view:** On an asset page, show each period's depreciation amounts and if posted or upcoming. Possibly allow manual posting from there, or schedule automated posting (likely monthly end).
- **Maintenance**: Asset page might list last service date and next service due if schedule is set (coming from maintenance schedule in Support).
- **Disposal Wizard:** Some UI to retire an asset: input disposal date, if sold then sale amount and buyer. The system then computes gain/loss and prompts to confirm accounting entries.

Mobile usage might be limited for assets since typically it's back-office, but could allow scanning an asset tag with phone to bring up its info (for audit or maintenance on-site). E.g., tech scans fridge QR code and sees its maintenance history and enters new log.

**Offline Capabilities:** Asset data management is likely done online since it's not a high-frequency thing. But if needed, an offline scenario might be auditing assets in a warehouse with no net: user could have the list cached, tick off what they find or update location offline, then sync changes later. Not critical, but feasible.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Noluthando runs a small bakery. She has a big oven, two fridges, a company motorbike for deliveries, and some industrial mixers. She records each in TOSS Assets. For her oven (cost R50k), she sets useful life 10 years, salvage R5k. TOSS schedules depreciation ~R375 per month. Each month, a Journal Entry is auto-posted to charge Depreciation Expense and reduce oven's book value by R375.

Noluthando can at any time open the Asset register to see the oven's current book value (say after 2 years, ~R41k)[\[71\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=,Provide%20valuation%20of%20each%20product). This helps for insurance or selling decisions.

Her fridges (provided by a beverage company) are technically on loan; she still lists them with a note they're supplier-owned to track maintenance but she might not depreciate them as they're not purchased assets.

The **motorbike** (cost R20k) is depreciating over 4 years. Also, she schedules maintenance: oil change every 6 months. TOSS is integrated, so a month before due, a maintenance ticket is created in Support module: "Bike ABC123: 6-month service due". She gets it serviced and logs that in the ticket (which links back to the asset record as well). She also enters that it cost R500 in that ticket; later, she can see total maintenance cost on the bike's asset page.

One day, one of her mixers breaks irreparably after 3 years. It had cost R5k with 5-year life, so book value is about R2k. She disposes it in TOSS: marks asset as sold for scrap at R1k. TOSS posts a Journal: remove asset at R5k, remove accumulated depreciation ~R3k, book R2k loss (because only got R1k for an asset with R2k book value). This keeps accounts accurate, and the asset list now shows that mixer as Disposed (so she knows not to count it in inventory of equipment)[\[72\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=,product).

If Noluthando ever needs a loan, she has a clear record of her assets to show collateral. Also, at year-end, her accountant easily gets depreciation totals from TOSS for financial statements (no manual calc needed).\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** AI can help by monitoring asset performance and giving suggestions: - **Maintenance Prediction:** Based on usage or past issues logged, predict if an asset might fail soon. E.g., "Fridge #2 has had 3 repairs in 6 months, consider replacing it"[\[37\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L510-L514). - **Optimal Replacement Time:** Considering depreciation and maintenance costs, AI might recommend when it's more cost-effective to buy new vs maintain old. ("Your oven is fully depreciated and maintenance costs last year were high - consider a new one with energy savings features"). - **Asset Utilization:** If some assets are rarely used, AI could flag "Truck has been idle 80% of days - maybe lease it out or sell it to free capital." - **Insurance Reminder:** "Asset X's warranty or insurance is expiring next month" so she can renew or check it. - **Asset life extension**: Maybe AI suggests "Regularly cleaning oven filters could extend its life, and it's due now" tying in with support info, effectively giving proactive tips.

**Collaborative Network Features:** On a network level, assets can be part of the **sharing economy**: - **Shared Asset Registry:** The network might have a pool of shared assets (like a community generator, a delivery van, etc.). TOSS can manage those by having an asset belonging to one entity but usage schedules accessible to others. Possibly an asset could be "leased" across tenants via events. - **Group Buying for Assets:** If multiple businesses need similar equipment, network AI could identify that and suggest a group purchase to get a discount (ties with Buying collab). E.g., "5 shops need freezers; negotiate as group buy via network". - **Lending Assets:** A business could mark an asset as available for rent to others (like a heavy duty printer one shop rents evenings to neighbors). Through the network, others could request usage, and TOSS would log transfer of custody temporarily. This requires a trust layer and maybe a token exchange or so. - **Asset Transfer:** If one business closes or upgrades, they could sell an asset to another network member. TOSS can facilitate a smooth transfer: one's disposal becomes another's acquisition, possibly through a linked transaction so both records update. - **Benchmarking:** The network might gather asset reliability data. E.g., "All network bakeries using Oven Model Z had average life of 8 years with X maintenance cost - so consider that when buying new ovens." This leverages collective experience to advise individuals.

- **Insurance Negotiation:** The network could approach insurers with the collective asset base to get cheaper insurance for all. TOSS could produce a combined assets valuation report (with permission) to show total assets to insure. It might also then handle if an insurance claim is needed network can expedite it (like standardized logs from TOSS proving maintenance was done etc., easing claims).

In essence, the Assets module focuses on each business's capital goods, but network features allow them to leverage each other for better asset utilization, purchasing power, and learning from shared maintenance data[\[73\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L511-L514).

## Quality (Quality Management Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Quality module implements a **Quality Management System (QMS)** to ensure products or services meet certain standards. It covers **quality inspections, testing, non-conformance handling, and continuous improvement** activities[\[43\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,insights%20into%20production%20performance%2C%20costs). In manufacturing contexts, it's used to inspect raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods. In retail or service contexts, it might handle things like checking perishable stock for expiration, ensuring service procedures are followed, or customer feedback logging for quality improvement. For township businesses, formal QMS might be new, but key principles like not selling expired goods, maintaining hygiene, and delivering consistent product quality can be managed through this module.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Quality Inspection Plans:** Define **Quality Criteria** for items or processes. For example, for a batch of bread: criteria could be weight, color, taste. Or for a service (like a haircut), maybe a checklist of steps to ensure consistency. These criteria can be part of **Quality Inspection Templates** for recurring use.
- **Incoming Quality Checks:** When receiving supplies (raw materials or goods), perform a **Quality Inspection** on a sample[\[74\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,insights%20into%20production%20performance%2C%20costs). For instance, check if eggs delivered are not cracked or if flour moisture is within spec. Record results (pass/fail or numeric measurements). If an item fails, mark the lot as rejected or to be returned to supplier.
- **In-Process Inspections:** If manufacturing, at certain stages do checks. E.g., check temperature of oven, or first output piece's dimensions. Log any adjustments needed.
- **Final Inspection & Testing:** Before product is delivered or put on shelf, do a final check against spec. E.g., for a furniture piece: verify dimensions and finish quality. If passes, allow sale; if fails, classify it as second-grade or rework if possible.
- **Non-Conformance Reporting (NCR):** If a quality issue is found (product defect, process deviation, customer complaint regarding quality), raise a **Non-Conformance** record[\[29\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L426-L434). Document what went wrong, immediate correction (e.g., removed bad items), and classify severity.
- **Corrective/Preventive Action (CAPA):** For serious or recurring issues, plan **Corrective Action** to fix root cause and **Preventive Action** to avoid recurrence[\[75\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L436-L439). The module might allow linking non-conformance to a CAPA task or project. E.g., if bread often too dense, investigate recipe or oven temp (corrective action: adjust yeast quantity and train staff).
- **Quality Meetings/Reviews:** Some QMS require periodic quality meetings to review metrics and issues[\[76\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L254-L262). The module can schedule these (maybe integrated with Projects or as events) and record decisions.
- **Quality Audit/Compliance:** If there are external standards (like health code, or a certification standard), the module can store audit checklists or compliance checks to ensure readiness. Possibly tie with Support/Audits for internal audit tasks[\[77\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L466-L474).

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Mandatory Inspections:** Configure that certain items must undergo inspection at receipt or before dispatch. The system might prevent stock from being used until inspection done (if that's desired). Or at least remind the user.
- **Sampling Rules:** If not every piece is checked, define how sampling is done (like inspect 5 units out of batch of 100). The module should allow capturing how many tested and how many failed to compute acceptance.
- **Pass/Fail Criteria:** If numeric readings are logged (like thickness in mm), the system should know acceptable range from the template and auto-mark if within tolerance or not.
- **Issue Escalation:** If an inspection fails or non-conformance logged, perhaps automatically alert management if it's critical. For example, any "High severity" NCR could trigger immediate flag or create a task for CAPA with high priority.
- **Traceability:** Keep references - e.g., quality inspection should link to the batch/serial of items or the specific PO receipt. If later an issue, one can trace which batch it came from and who supplied it[\[43\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,insights%20into%20production%20performance%2C%20costs). If stock is in batches, a fail might mark that batch as quarantined.
- **Closing the Loop:** Ensure that for each non-conformance, a resolution or CAPA is eventually completed. The system might not enforce, but should encourage closing NCRs with noted actions.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Encourage using data from quality logs - e.g., trending defect rates. Possibly require monthly review of some metrics if formal.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Quality Inspection Template:** Fields - Item or Process applicable, list of Parameters (each parameter with expected range or qualitative criteria, and maybe UoM).
- **Quality Inspection:** Fields - reference (e.g., Purchase Receipt or Production Order or Batch no.), date, inspector, result for each Parameter (could be numeric value and a pass/fail or just pass/fail for that test). Overall status (Accepted/Rejected) and any remarks. Possibly attach photos (like picture of defect).
- **Non-Conformance Report:** Fields - Reference (could link to a specific job, batch, or just date), description of issue, category (supplier issue, internal process, customer complaint, safety issue, etc.), severity, immediate action taken, responsible person, and status (Open, Investigating, Resolved).
- **Corrective Action Request/Plan:** Could be a separate doctype or just fields in the NCR - describing root cause found, corrective action steps, preventive measures, who is assigned, and due date for completion. Possibly link to a Project or Task for execution.
- **Quality Meeting/Review:** If tracked, fields - date, attendees, topics discussed (like recurring high defect in X, etc.), decisions (maybe link to actions to take - which might again connect to tasks or CAPAs).
- **Quality Goals/Indicators:** Could store target metrics like "Defect rate under 2%". But likely not needed at first; can do on reports.

**User Interface & Experience:**

- For daily users (like QC inspectors or workers doing checks), a **Quality Inspection form** should be quick to fill. Possibly a mobile-friendly checklist: e.g., select batch, then a list like "Parameter: Appearance - Pass/Fail (tick or X); Parameter: Weight - input number (e.g., 500g) then system shows if pass or fail next to it." Submit yields result. On mobile, might even incorporate capturing a photo if needed (like a photo of the defect for evidence).
- For managers, a **Quality Dashboard** might show number of NCRs open, by type, and any trending issues. Possibly charts like defect rate by month, or by supplier (if lots of issues from one supplier).
- **NCR list:** A page listing open non-conformances, with filters by severity or department. Easy way to click in and update status or assign actions.
- **CAPA tracking:** perhaps integrated with Projects or a simple list of tasks generated from each NCR requiring a long-term fix. Mark them complete once done, which then can automatically close the NCR if appropriate.
- If integrated with maintenance and support: could combine audits and quality checks in one view for operations (like a store audit may double-check quality aspects, etc., but that's advanced).
- **Alerts:** if a critical issue flagged (like "contamination in product"), the system could highlight it in red, maybe even present a suggestion: e.g., "Quarantine batch, inform all customers who bought from this batch (the system could know invoices of that batch if trackable)". That would be ideal but requires lot of integration.

**Offline Capabilities:** If inspections are done on a factory floor or remote site without wifi, the user can input results offline (like via the mobile app) and sync later. Quality checks are often time-sensitive though, so likely they'd have local network at least. But offline is possible: just storing the form and sending later.

Non-conformance logging could also be offline if someone is in field noticing an issue (like a technician finds an assembly problem at a client site, logs NCR offline).

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Dlamini runs a small dairy producing cheese. Quality is key since any spoilage can tarnish reputation and safety. He uses Quality module to ensure standards:

When milk is delivered daily from farmers, his assistant uses a **Quality Inspection** form: tests butterfat percentage and smell. Template says acceptable fat range 3-4%. He measures 3.5% (records it, system marks pass), smell = "normal" (qualitative pass). If any day's milk smells off or shows contamination (like a high acidity reading), he would Reject that batch - the system logs it and triggers an alert to not use that milk in production[\[43\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,insights%20into%20production%20performance%2C%20costs).

During production, they also do checks: after pasteurization, check temperature logs, etc. For each batch of cheese, before packaging, a sample is tasted and weighed. He enters those in an inspection record tied to that batch number. One time, weight was consistently 5% low on a batch - he flags that but still goes ahead, just noted for info.

Now, one week, they had 3 customer complaints of cheese getting moldy before expiry. Dlamini opens a **Non-Conformance Report** for "Cheese shelf life issue". He notes the batch numbers affected, severity medium (quality issue but not health-critical since mold is natural albeit unwanted early). He and team investigate - find that the new packaging supplier's wraps may not be sealing well.

In the NCR, he writes the suspected root cause and raises a **Corrective Action**: switch to a different packaging or improve sealing process. He sets it as a task for next week to test new packaging. Meanwhile, immediate action was to apologize to customers and replace their products (he records those replacements via support/warranty or just inventory adjustment).

He monitors that no more complaints come after they improved sealing. He then marks the NCR resolved, with a note "Switched packaging supplier, increased dryness in packaging area. No early mold observed in subsequent batches."

Also, Dlamini has periodic **Quality Meetings** with his two staff where they review any issues and ideas. TOSS might not formally record these, but he could use Projects or just notes.

Using the module, he reduces waste (by catching bad milk at intake) and improves consistency. Over months, he sees from reports that "defects per batch" is down and customer satisfaction up - valuable insights that he can also share when pursuing certifications or marketing his quality focus.\*

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** AI can significantly assist in Quality: - **Trend Detection:** It can analyze inspection data and highlight subtle trends: "The moisture content of flour has been creeping up over last 5 lots - could affect bread texture." Or "5% of items from Supplier X failed inspection in last quarter vs 1% average - maybe there's an issue[\[78\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L361-L364)." - **Predictive Quality:** Combining factors, AI might predict when processes are likely to produce defects. E.g., "Cheese mold issue likely when humidity > 80% in curing room - ensure dehumidifier use in rainy weeks" if it finds correlation between logged environmental data and defects. - **Root Cause Assistance:** For an NCR, the AI might search similar cases in the knowledge base or past records to suggest probable causes and solutions. E.g., "Early mold often due to packaging - check seal integrity" pulled from past resolved cases. - **Automated Quality Scoring:** If using visual inspection, perhaps in future hooking an AI vision to detect defects (like scanning product photos for irregularities). Possibly too advanced for now, but conceptually within AI's help in QC. - **CAPA Effectiveness:** AI can review if after certain CAPAs, relevant metrics improved or not, thus telling you if the fix truly worked or if further action needed (closing the PDCA loop). - **Regulatory Reminders:** If there are standards to maintain (like HACCP in food), AI can remind to do required checks or documentation. - Also linking with network: if a particular defect has been reported by multiple businesses in the network (all buying from same supplier), AI might connect those dots and warn everyone or escalate collectively.

**Collaborative Network Features:** Quality in a network can have a communal dimension: - **Shared Quality Standards:** If the network (like a cooperative) wants to enforce a baseline quality, they can share inspection templates or require all members to do certain checks. TOSS can push standard templates to all members' Quality module. E.g., all cooperative bakers must test bread weight, which then could be reported to central. - **Supplier Quality Management:** As in collab buying, the network can track supplier performance. If multiple members log NCRs against a supplier's product, the network leadership can aggregate that and approach the supplier for corrective action or use it as leverage for discounts/ improvements[\[29\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L426-L434). - **External Audits:** The network might collectively hire an auditor to inspect members. That auditor could have limited access to each tenant's Quality data via the network (if permitted) or TOSS could have an Audit connector. They then produce an overall compliance report, highlighting who needs improvement (like in a franchise model but here a coop model). - **Quality Benchmarking:** Compare defect rates or scrap rates across the network (anonymously or within a group). This could spur friendly competition or identify who has best practices. If one shop has nearly zero defects, others could learn from them (maybe that shop shares their process via knowledge base or training). - **Knowledge Base Sharing:** Absolutely - quality solutions and SOPs should be shareable. The network could maintain a central repository of best practices (e.g., safe food handling procedures, cleaning schedules, etc.) that all members import or reference[\[75\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L436-L439). - **Recall Management:** If a product is recalled (like a supplier issues recall on a batch of flour contaminated), through the network all businesses can be alerted and identify if they have that batch in stock (because TOSS knows batches). This quick collective response is crucial for things like food safety. The network could coordinate retrieving those products from all member shops quickly. - **Training & Certification:** The network might facilitate quality training and track who has attended. TOSS could help schedule and record such training events (slightly HR-ish but related to quality competency). - **Cooperative Quality Label:** Possibly, the network brand could have a label e.g., "Network Approved Quality" if all members adhere to certain checks. TOSS quality data could be used to prove compliance (like internal certification).

In essence, Quality module in the network fosters a culture where everyone benefits from improved quality standards - better products, fewer returns, stronger community reputation[\[79\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L480-L488). It's a key part of that third layer (collaborative network), ensuring the whole group stands for excellence.

## Website (Website & E-Commerce Module)

**Overview & Purpose:** The Website module allows businesses to create a basic web presence (and even a simple e-commerce storefront) directly from TOSS[\[80\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/website#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20not%20a%20web,Using%20this%20module%2C%20you%20can). It covers building web pages (home page, about, contact), listing products or services online, possibly blogging for marketing, and enabling an online shopping cart for customers to place orders. It essentially turns the ERP data (items, blogs, etc.) into a website without needing separate web development, which is great for small businesses who want an online footprint but can't invest in a custom site.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Website Setup:** Configure site settings - domain (maybe a subdomain on toss.net or custom domain), site name, logo, theme colors, etc.[\[80\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/website#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20not%20a%20web,Using%20this%20module%2C%20you%20can).
- **Web Pages:** Create static content pages using a CMS-like editor or templated forms. E.g., "Home", "About Us", "Contact Us". Possibly allow sections with images, text, maybe embedded map for address, etc.
- **Product Catalog:** If the business sells products, the **Item master** can be marked "Show on Website"[\[81\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/website#:~:text=,products%20using%20the%20Shopping%20Cart). Those items then appear on a product listing page (with categories). Each item will have a detail page with description, price, maybe an image gallery, and an "Add to Cart" button for e-commerce.
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout:** Customers visiting the site can browse items, add to a cart (with quantity), and then proceed to checkout. They might need to sign up or checkout as guest providing delivery info. The system generates a **Sales Order** or **Quotation** in TOSS when they place the order, which the business then processes (the workflow could integrate with Selling/CRM). Payment could be offline (like COD) or online if a payment gateway integrated (maybe not initially, but possible).
- **Contact Forms & Lead Capture:** The Contact Us page could send inquiries into TOSS as leads or support tickets. Similarly, a "Request a Quote" form could generate a lead or opportunity.
- **Blogging/News:** The module supports **Blog Posts**[\[81\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/website#:~:text=,products%20using%20the%20Shopping%20Cart). Businesses can post news, promotions, or educational content. This helps with marketing. The blog has categories and archives, etc.
- **Portal**: There might be a **Customer Portal** where customers who log in can see their orders, invoices, make payments, etc. If enabled, TOSS uses existing records to show them status (this is advanced but ERPNext does it).
- **SEO & Meta Tags:** Manage meta tags, keywords for pages to be search engine friendly. Also possibly auto-generating sitemap.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Content Approval:** Maybe not needed for a small own site, but changes might either go live immediately or require an admin user to publish.
- **Item Availability:** Only show items in stock (configurable) or at least mark if out-of-stock. Also, items may have a tick if they are available for sale online vs only in-store.
- **Pricing Consistency:** Website shows the same price as in ERP (pulls from price list). If multiple price lists (like retail vs wholesale), ensure correct one is used for site visitors (likely a default web price list).
- **Cart Stock Check:** When customer attempts checkout, check that stock is still available for those items (especially if real-time inventory display). If not, warn or prevent ordering out-of-stock items unless backorders are allowed.
- **User Accounts:** If using portal, need authentication via email/password or OTP. Basic security in place.
- **Order Confirmation:** Possibly send an email confirmation to customer on order placement. Ensure those templates are set up.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** If implemented, handle success/cancel webhooks to mark payment status on orders.
- **Privacy/POPIA compliance:** If collecting user data, need a privacy policy page, and not misuse data. Possibly a cookie notice if needed (maybe overhead for small site, but compliance wise).
- **Multi-Tenancy for websites:** Each business likely has their own site section or subdomain. The system must isolate content per tenant obviously. If network wants a combined marketplace, that might be a separate site aggregating items from multiple tenants.

**Data Model & Key Fields:**

- **Website Settings:** Fields - site name, banner image, homepage route, etc., also toggles like "Allow signup", "Show in portal: orders, invoices, etc.".
- **Web Page:** Fields - title, route (URL path), content (could be rich text / HTML or structured blocks), published yes/no.
- **Web Menu:** For navigation bars, define menu items linking to pages or external links.
- **Blog Post:** Fields - title, content, blog category, author, published date, etc. Possibly can attach images. Blog Category (like an entity).
- **Web Slideshow / Banner:** Possibly a doctype for homepage slide show images and text.
- **Item (with Website fields):** In Item master extended fields - show on website (yes/no), website description (maybe a richer description than internal one), website image (if separate from item image), and maybe SEO meta for that item.
- **Cart/Order (for e-comm):** Possibly ephemeral until submitted. But likely just directly uses Sales Order or a separate "Shopping Cart" session object stored server-side or cookies until checkout. On submission, a Sales Order is created with link to web user.
- **Web User / Portal User:** Actually same as system user with a Customer role, limited permissions. They link to a Contact/Customer record to know whose orders to show.
- **Website Theme:** There might be a theme doctype to manage CSS, colors, etc. Or a fixed theme with minor customizations in settings.

**User Interface & Experience:**

For the business user (admin): - There might be a **Website Builder** interface to create and arrange pages. Possibly a simple WYSIWYG editor for pages content or templates to fill. It should be easy for a non-technical user to update text or add a new blog post (like writing a WordPress post). - **Preview** mode for pages before publishing changes. - A section in TOSS for Website where they manage menus, pages, and blog posts as forms. - Perhaps the .template files or pre-built design from the UI guidelines (like using Creative Tim theme) will style the site nicely by default.

For the external visitor: - The site would likely have a common header with company name/logo, nav menu, and a footer with contact details etc. - Homepage might feature a welcome message or some featured products (maybe configurable which items to feature). - If e-commerce: product listing page shows product name, thumbnail, price, maybe an "Add to cart" or link to detail. Filtering by category could be available. - Product detail page shows bigger images, description, maybe reviews (unlikely unless added later) and add to cart form (quantity and add). - The cart page shows chosen items, allows adjustments, then a checkout form for address and contact, then final confirmation. - If portal login: a login/register page. Portal dashboard with maybe "My Orders, My Invoices, My Profile". - Also pages like About Us (with rich text content describing business), Contact (with a form and contact info). - The design should be mobile-responsive, given many might browse on phones.

**Offline Capabilities:** The website is inherently an online feature. However, the PWA aspect could allow some offline browsing if cached (like last viewed pages), but that's advanced. For the admin, editing site requires connection to the server obviously. So offline not applicable here.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Mama Thandi runs a crafts business (woven baskets, mats). She wants to reach more customers outside her immediate area. Using TOSS Website, she sets up an online storefront:

She goes to Website module, enters a catchy site title "Thandi's African Crafts". She uploads her logo. She writes an **About Us** page talking about her story and community impact. She creates a **Contact Us** page with her shop address, phone, and a form that visitors can submit inquiries (which TOSS will log as leads in CRM).

She has 10 product types. In the Item master, each item (like "Large Woven Basket") already had descriptions and prices for ERP. She adds a nice photo to each and marks "Show on website". She writes a bit more marketing description in the "website description" field (like emphasizing it's hand-made, dimensions, etc.). TOSS generates a product listing automatically by category (baskets vs mats), which she can reorder or refine.

Now her site is live at something like toss.site/thandicrafts (or a custom domain if she set one). A customer in another town finds it via Google (the site is simple but has her blog posts about weaving which show up in search). They browse her products, add a couple to cart, and place an order for delivery.

TOSS captures this order as a **Sales Order** under Mama Thandi's account, marked as from Website. She gets alerted in TOSS "New Online Order #1001". Since she hasn't integrated online payments yet, the site is set to "Cash on Delivery". She contacts the customer for delivery arrangements (maybe she could integrate with a driver network from the collab layer for shipping).

She fulfills the order and marks it as delivered in TOSS, and could then email an invoice. The customer upon logging in can see the status "Delivered" and maybe leave feedback.

Additionally, Mama Thandi writes periodic **Blog Posts** on her site about the significance of certain weaving patterns. Locals and even some international visitors read these, raising her profile. This content marketing helps drive traffic to her site, and she notices an uptick in online inquiries (which feed into CRM leads).

All of this, she did without hiring a web developer - just using TOSS's built-in website builder. It's not a fancy custom site, but it is good enough to showcase her products and accept orders, which is a huge leap for her business.\*[\[82\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/website#:~:text=Websites%20are%20a%20core%20component,and%20it%20not%20being%20interactive)

**SaaS 2.0 (AI & Insights):** The AI can assist with: - **SEO suggestions:** e.g., advise adding certain keywords to product pages or blog posts, or suggest "Your page title is a bit long, shorten for better search ranking". - **Content creation help:** maybe even help draft blog posts or product descriptions by providing templates or analyzing what attracts customers (maybe integrated with a language model). - **Product recommendation and personalization:** if portal users log in, AI could suggest products they might like based on past orders or browsing (like simple "customers who bought this also liked that" which could be gleaned from network data if enough volume). - **Web analytics:** Provide insight on website traffic and behavior: "Your site got 500 visits this week (up 10%). Most viewed product: Woven Mat. Consider promoting that." or "Many users drop off at checkout - maybe simplify the checkout process". - **Customer reviews sentiment:** If the site collects feedback or reviews, AI can analyze sentiment and highlight common praises or issues. - **Optimal posting times:** For her blog, AI might suggest when to post or what topics (like noticing which posts get more views or shares). - Possibly tie into social - not exactly website, but AI might recommend sharing new blog post to a linked Facebook page to drive traffic (though that is more external integration).

**Collaborative Network Features:** The network could leverage websites as: - **Central Marketplace:** Imagine a network site listing all member products (like an online mall). TOSS could aggregate items from multiple tenants into one front-end (with proper multi-tenancy handling of orders). Perhaps an advanced concept, but doable if the network chooses to have a unified e-commerce portal (customers can order from multiple shops at once; TOSS splits the order to each vendor's Sales Orders and coordinates payments and deliveries across them). This is complex but a powerful network synergy - small businesses get an exposure as if one big platform (like Etsy style but local). - **Shared Content:** The network could maintain a blog for the community or share content. For instance, a business might allow the network to automatically display relevant posts or adverts. Or a cooperative could push announcements to member sites (like "Shop Local Week promotion" banner shows on all member's websites). - **Domain & Hosting support:** The network might handle custom domain setup or ensure hosting. If a member can't afford domain, they can have a subdomain on the network's domain. If network invests in better server/backbone, all benefit (TOSS cloud presumably covers hosting though). - **Training customers to use portal:** If multiple businesses in network adopt TOSS website, they can collectively educate the community on using these online shops, possibly unify login (like one network login can access all portal if some SSO implemented - maybe far-fetched, but conceptually a "One login for township marketplace" could be nice). - **Data sharing for better SEO:** Network could ensure cross-linking between member sites to improve search rankings (like a directory of local businesses with links to each site). - **Security and updates:** The network ensures that all member websites get timely security updates or upgrades (TOSS does that centrally anyway). Possibly also content moderation if needed (to ensure nothing inappropriate, if network brand is attached). - **Collective analytics:** The network can see aggregate web analytics to understand overall demand trends. If many searches or hits for "handmade baskets", network could encourage more members to list such or do group promotions.

In short, the Website module allows each small business to punch above its weight online, and the network can amplify that by creating a local digital marketplace where all members are visible and easily accessible to customers beyond foot traffic[\[81\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/website#:~:text=,products%20using%20the%20Shopping%20Cart).

(Each module above is thoroughly detailed in the context of TOSS, drawing parallels to ERPNext modules and tailoring them to the township business scenario. The SaaS 2.0 and network aspects are integrated or appended to each section, as requested, and there's alignment with references and guidelines from ERPNext documentation and TOSS vision documents throughout.)

# TOSS Platform Functional Specification v1.0

## Introduction

**TOSS (The One-Stop Solution)** is a next-generation ERP-III platform tailored for South African township and rural businesses. It combines a full suite of ERP modules with intelligent _Service-as-Software (SaaS 2.0)_ features and a _Collaborative Network_ layer to help small businesses not just manage operations, but also gain insights and work together as a community[\[1\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L52-L60)[\[2\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L118-L126). The system is **offline-first and mobile-first**, delivered as a Nuxt 4 Progressive Web App for low-end Android devices, and powered by a multi-tenant, event-driven .NET 8 backend (Clean Architecture with PostgreSQL)[\[3\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L263-L271)[\[4\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L243-L250). Every design choice aligns with ERPNext's proven ERP module concepts[\[9\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L160-L169), adapted to be simpler and more context-appropriate for users like spaza shop owners, hawkers, small-scale manufacturers, and other township entrepreneurs.

**Product Pillars:** The platform consists of three integrated layers[\[6\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L90-L98):

- **ERP-III Modules (Business Backbone):** Traditional ERP domains (Sales, Purchasing, Accounting, Stock, etc.) providing the essential tools to run a business.
- **SaaS 2.0 (AI Business Coach):** An AI-driven layer that watches business data and proactively suggests actions or automations (acting as a "business manager with an MBA")[\[7\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L110-L118).
- **Collaborative Network:** Multi-tenant capabilities that let independent businesses cooperate - pooling orders, sharing resources, and collectively negotiating as a network[\[8\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L120-L124).

In the sections below, each ERP module is specified in detail - including its purpose, key workflows, business rules, data model, UI/UX expectations (with offline functionality), and an example use case in a township/rural context. Subsequent sections describe how the AI SaaS layer and Collaborative Network layer augment these modules with insights and cross-organization workflows. All functionality is aligned with ERPNext's documented features for familiarity and robustness[\[5\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L158-L166), while ensuring the solution remains **simple, offline-capable, and intuitive** for the target users[\[11\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L54-L61).

## Selling (Sales & Marketing Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The Selling module in TOSS streamlines the entire sales process from initial customer inquiry to final sale, while also helping manage customer relationships. It covers customer inquiries, quotations, sales orders, deliveries, and invoicing - integrating closely with CRM and Accounting. In essence, this module helps businesses efficiently **generate and track sales** and maintain customer info to improve service and drive revenue growth[\[12\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=The%20Selling%20module%20in%20ERPNext,and%20enhance%20customer%20relationship%20management)[\[15\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=,trends%20to%20inform%20strategic%20decisions). It also supports basic marketing functions like tracking campaigns or customer referrals relevant to township businesses (e.g. loyalty programs or word-of-mouth promotions).

**Core Workflows:** Key workflows in Selling include:

- **Lead-to-Quote:** Capture a lead or inquiry (via CRM) then create a **Quotation** (sales quote) for the products/services the customer is interested in. Quotations can be sent to customers and later converted to orders[\[14\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=,on%20sales%20performance%2C%20revenue%2C%20and).
- **Order Fulfillment:** Convert an accepted quotation into a **Sales Order**. The Sales Order is the confirmed customer order, which initiates reservation of stock. From the Sales Order, generate a **Delivery Note** (for physical goods) to ship items, and finally create a **Sales Invoice** to bill the customer[\[14\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=,on%20sales%20performance%2C%20revenue%2C%20and).
- **Direct Sale (POS):** For walk-in or counter sales, use the POS sub-module for a quick invoice and immediate payment (see **POS module** below). POS sales automatically deduct stock and create accounting entries on sync.
- **Returns & Credit Notes:** If a customer returns a product, record a **Sales Return** (Credit Note) which updates stock and creates a credit/refund record in accounting.
- **Customer Management & Follow-up:** Maintain a master list of **Customers** with contact info, delivery addresses, and perhaps loyalty details. Track communication leading up to a sale (linked emails/calls via CRM) so that all quotes and orders are in context[\[15\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/selling#:~:text=,trends%20to%20inform%20strategic%20decisions). Payment terms and credit limits per customer can be enforced to manage credit sales (e.g., block new orders if a customer exceeds their credit limit).

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Quotation Validity & Approval:** Quotations carry an expiry date; the system prevents converting an expired quote to an order without extension. Optionally, set approval requirements for quotes giving large discounts or special terms.
- **Stock Reservation:** Confirming a Sales Order will allocate stock from inventory (if the item is stock-managed). The system will not allow delivery of more than the ordered quantity or more than what's available in stock (unless backordering is allowed). If an item is out-of-stock at order time, the system can flag it for purchase or transfer.
- **Pricing and Discounts:** The module enforces the price list rates by default. If a salesperson applies a manual discount beyond a certain threshold, it can require manager approval. TOSS supports promotional pricing rules and coupon codes like ERPNext, but in simpler form (e.g., an automatic 10% off on certain items during a sale period)[\[16\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=What%20features%20are%20available%20in,the%20Sales%20module).
- **Status Transitions:** Documents follow defined statuses - e.g., Quotation (Draft → Submitted → Ordered/Lost), Sales Order (Draft/Confirmed → Partly Delivered → Completed/Closed). The system automatically updates status based on actions (e.g., marking a Sales Order as Completed once fully delivered and invoiced).
- **Customer Credit Control:** If a customer has exceeded their credit limit or has overdue invoices, TOSS can warn or block new Sales Orders for that customer (configurable). This prevents overextending credit to customers who might default.
- **Integration with Accounting:** Posting a Sales Invoice will automatically update the Accounts Receivable for that customer and record revenue. The module ensures each invoice has proper tax calculations and accounting impact. In TOSS, however, accounting jargon is minimized - for example, users see "Money In" entries rather than "debit to debtor account" (the underlying double-entry happens invisibly).

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:** Important DocTypes in Selling include:

- **Customer:** Stores customer details (Name, contact info, customer type/territory, credit limit, default price list, etc.).
- **Quotation:** Key fields - Customer, Valid Till Date, Item table (items, quantities, rates, any discount), Taxes/charges, Total amount, Status. It may also include terms or notes for the quotation.
- **Sales Order:** Key fields - Customer, Delivery Date, Item table (with quantities and rates locked in), workflow Status, and links to subsequent Delivery Notes and Invoices. Has flags like _"Drop-ship"_ or _"Maintenance Required"_ if relevant.
- **Delivery Note:** Fields - Linked Sales Order (optional), Items delivered (with actual quantities, batch/serial numbers if tracking), Delivery Date, and status (Draft, Submitted, etc.). This updates stock levels.
- **Sales Invoice:** Fields - Customer, Invoice Date, Due Date, Item table (quantities, rates), Taxes, Totals, Payments (if paid immediately), and status (Unpaid/Paid/Cancelled). In TOSS, a Sales Invoice can be used for immediate payment scenarios (POS) or credit sales (with later payment entry).
- **Payment Entry (for Sales):** If customers pay after invoicing, a Payment Entry record links the payment to one or multiple invoices, recording the date, mode (cash, bank, mobile money), and amount received[\[39\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=In%20ERPNext%2C%20accounting%20operations%20consists,of%203%20main%20transactions).
- **Pricing Rule:** (If used) Defines special pricing or discounts for certain conditions (e.g., customer group, quantity break). Key fields - applicable item/customer, min quantity, rate or discount percentage.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Selling module's UI is designed to be friendly and accessible on mobile devices. Transaction forms use **plain, friendly language** instead of accounting jargon[\[18\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L294-L301). For example, the Sales Invoice form might label fields as "Money Received?" instead of "Is Paid," and show "People who owe you" for the receivables list[\[18\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L294-L301).

Creating a new sale is straightforward: a user can tap **"New Sale Order"** and then select a customer (with an option to quickly add a new customer if not already in the list). They then add items by typing the first letters or scanning a barcode (the app provides typeahead search through the item list). On a phone, items can be added via a plus-button or by entering a SKU. The form automatically computes totals and applicable taxes. The UI supports splitting an order into multiple deliveries (for backorders) with a clear "Delivered" vs "Pending" status on each item line.

Mobile-first design means forms are broken into sections that can collapse for ease of navigation. For instance, on a small screen, the Sales Order form might first show "Customer & Date" section, then an "Items" section, then a "Summary & Submit" section. This avoids one long scrolling form. There's also a prominent **Submit/Confirm** button at the end to finalize the order.

Throughout the UI, the terminology is simplified: "New Sale" (Sales Order), "Send Bill" (Invoice), "Record Payment" instead of "Journal Entry"[\[18\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L294-L301). The module also uses a **topbar search** where a user can search for any sales document by customer name or item, and TOSS will bring relevant results (leveraging global search).

**Offline Capabilities:** Core sales flows are supported offline for resiliency. Sales Orders and Invoices can be **created offline** if the device is not connected - they will be stored locally in the app's database. Each offline transaction gets a temporary ID. Once connectivity is restored, the app syncs these to the server, which assigns official numbers and integrates them into stock and accounts. In practice, for a typical sales order (which usually might be taken when somewhat online), offline is less common than in POS, but it's possible (e.g., writing an order at a remote client site). The system's design ensures that even if multiple offline orders are queued, when syncing it resolves any numbering or stock allocation conflicts gracefully (using timestamps and device IDs)[\[35\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L316-L324).

For example, a salesperson out in the field can create a quote or order on their phone without network. The customer's details and item catalog are cached, so selection is easy. Later, when back online, the quote syncs to the server and can be emailed out. The app will alert the user of any sync issues (say, if an item was discontinued during that period, it will flag it for correction). Overall, offline mode in Selling ensures no sale is lost just because of connectivity, and it queues all updates (stock, ledger entries) to apply once online.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Naledi runs a small hardware store in a township. Using the Selling module, she handles both walk-in customers and bulk orders from local contractors. A contractor comes in requesting a quote for 100 bags of cement and 20 steel pipes. Naledi quickly creates a_ _Quotation_ _on her tablet, selecting the customer (who is already in her CRM) and the items; the system pulls in her standard prices. She adds a note "Valid for 7 days" and sends it via WhatsApp directly from TOSS (the quotation PDF is generated in-app). The contractor confirms the next day, so Naledi converts that quote to a_ _Sales Order_\* with one tap. The stock for 100 cement and 20 pipes is now reserved under that order.

Naledi sees in TOSS that she only has 80 bags of cement in stock (20 short). The system, via the Stock module integration, automatically flags a **material shortage** for cement. She quickly creates a Purchase Order to her supplier for the remaining 20 (from the Buying module). Meanwhile, she partially fulfills the sales order: she delivers the 80 bags available, generating a **Delivery Note** and updating the order status to "Partly Delivered". The customer is fine with a split delivery.

Once the remaining cement arrives the next day, Naledi delivers them and the Sales Order is completed. TOSS generates a **Sales Invoice** for the full 100 bags and 20 pipes, since the order is now fully delivered. The contractor has 30-day payment terms. TOSS tracks this in Accounts Receivable (Naledi can see the invoice under "People who owe you" with due date)[\[18\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L294-L301).

At month-end, Naledi reviews her sales in the dashboard: she sees total sales, and specifically that contractor's large order is listed, helping her manage cash flow expectations. Because she recorded everything through the Selling module, her stock levels and financials stayed accurate throughout, and she maintained a professional interaction (quotes, invoices) with minimal effort.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** The Selling module is enhanced by AI-driven insights that act like a smart sales assistant. For example, the system can analyze customer buying patterns and suggest **upsell or cross-sell opportunities** to increase sales. When creating a sales order, TOSS might prompt: "Customers who bought cement often buy sand - add sand to this order?" based on historical data. The AI also keeps an eye on pricing and margins - if a salesperson gives an unusually large discount that brings margin below a set threshold, the system can flag it: _"Warning: Very low margin on Item X"_[\[83\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L112-L117). It could require manager approval or at least log this event for review, preventing inadvertent loss-making deals.

TOSS's AI "business coach" monitors sales trends and customer behavior. It might highlight that a formerly regular customer hasn't ordered in a while and suggest reaching out (a nudge to use the CRM for a follow-up call). It can also identify top customers and prompt Naledi with a message like: _"Thabo's Workshop has purchased R5,000 of goods this month - consider offering a loyalty discount or a thank-you note."_ These relationship-building cues help retention.

On a broader level, AI analyzes sales performance against targets. If it knows Naledi's weekly sales goal (she can set one), it can notify mid-week: _"You are 70% to your sales goal by Wednesday - on track!"_ or _"Sales are slower than usual this week, consider a promotion or SMS campaign to boost footfall."_ These friendly prompts in plain language help a busy shopkeeper take quick action.

**Collaborative Network Features:** Within a network of businesses, the Selling module enables cooperative sales and shared opportunities. For example, businesses can engage in **group sales or bulk deals** that they advertise collectively. If multiple shops form a buying group to negotiate better prices (see Buying module), they could also collectively offer a promotion (e.g., a township-wide sale event) to increase volume. The network layer might facilitate a **shared marketplace**: each shop's products could be listed on a central marketplace site (see Website module), effectively pooling their catalogs to attract more customers together than individually. Orders from that marketplace would route to the respective shop's Selling module for fulfillment.

In addition, the collaborative network allows referral sales: one business can refer a customer to another if they don't stock a requested item. Through TOSS, if Shop A doesn't have cement but knows Shop B in the network does, Shop A could create a referral sales order that Shop B fulfills. The system could credit Shop A with a referral commission automatically. This encourages businesses to **cross-refer** rather than let a customer leave the network.

The network layer can also share **sales insights across the community** (without revealing individual company data unless allowed). For instance, it could show to members: "Collectively, spaza shops in Network X sold 5000 loaves of bread this week." This kind of aggregate data might help each shop gauge demand trends or negotiate with bakeries as a group. If one shop's sales of a certain product are skyrocketing (maybe due to a local event or promotion), the network can propagate that knowledge so others can stock up and benefit too.

Lastly, collaborative selling efforts such as **group loyalty programs** can be managed. Customers could earn loyalty points across the entire network of shops (e.g., a customer earns points buying from Shop A and can redeem at Shop B). The Selling module, via the network, would update a central loyalty ledger. This drives customer stickiness to network businesses rather than to outside competitors. Overall, collaboration in selling transforms what individual small shops can do by themselves into what a coordinated group can achieve - whether it's bulk promotions, shared customers, or simply learning from each other's sales patterns.

## Buying (Procurement Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The Buying module manages the procurement process end-to-end, helping businesses efficiently purchase goods and services and maintain healthy supplier relationships. It covers everything from requesting supplier quotes, placing purchase orders, receiving goods into stock, to handling supplier invoices. Essentially, this module ensures that **stock is replenished** in a timely and controlled manner and that **purchases are cost-effective**[\[20\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=The%20Buying%20module%20in%20ERPNext,processes%20and%20optimise%20supplier%20relationships)[\[21\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=,levels%20and%20manage%20stock%20replenishment). For small businesses, this means simplifying tasks like reordering inventory and keeping track of payables so they can control costs and avoid stockouts.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Material Request (Requisition):** An internal request for items needed - e.g., a shop staff notices sugar is low and creates a **Material Request** for 50 kg of sugar. This is an optional step in TOSS (some might go straight to ordering), but useful for larger operations or for planning. Material Requests can later be merged into Purchase Orders.
- **Request for Quotation (RFQ):** If price comparison is needed, create an RFQ to send to multiple suppliers. In TOSS, you can note which items need quotes; the system can generate an email or print-out to send to chosen suppliers, requesting their prices. When they respond, you record their quotes (Supplier Quotation documents).
- **Supplier Quotation Evaluation:** Compare received quotes side-by-side (the system can tabulate price, terms, etc. for each supplier). Choose the best offer and convert it into a **Purchase Order**.
- **Purchase Order (PO):** Place the order with the chosen supplier. The PO specifies items, quantities, agreed prices, and expected delivery date[\[22\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=,levels%20and%20manage%20stock%20replenishment). Once submitted, the PO in TOSS is a formal commitment and it will reflect as "on order" stock. The system can email the PO to the supplier or generate a printout.
- **Goods Receipt:** When the supplier delivers, create a **Purchase Receipt** (Goods Received Note) to record the actual quantities received for each item. If an item is short or damaged, note it; the PO remains open for pending items or you initiate a return. Upon submission of a Purchase Receipt, inventory levels increase for those items in the specified warehouse.
- **Purchase Invoice:** Receive the supplier's bill and create a **Purchase Invoice** to record the amount owed. If the supplier invoice matches the PO/receipt, it's straightforward - TOSS copies the data from the PO or receipt. If there are differences (price changes, extra charges like shipping), you can adjust on the invoice. Submitting the Purchase Invoice will update Accounts Payable (the system records that you owe the supplier money)[\[84\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/buying#:~:text=,levels%20and%20manage%20stock%20replenishment).
- **Payment to Supplier:** When you pay the supplier (advance, on delivery, or credit term), record a Payment Entry (or mark invoice as paid) to clear the liability. TOSS can handle partial payments and will show outstanding balances per supplier.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Order Authorization:** Optionally require approval for POs above certain amounts (to enforce spend control). This can be configured via workflow if needed.
- **Three-way Match:** TOSS facilitates matching the PO, Receipt, and Invoice. If a Purchase Invoice is entered for more quantity than received or higher price than in PO, the system flags it. Minor variances can be allowed within a tolerance. This ensures you only pay for what was actually received and agreed. For example, if the PO was 100 units at R50 but only 90 delivered, it will warn if invoiced for 100 or if price increased unless you adjust the records intentionally.
- **Stock Update Accuracy:** A Purchase Receipt cannot be submitted without specifying the warehouse for stock and (if enabled) batch or serial numbers for items that require them. Also, if an item is found defective at receipt, it can be marked as rejected - the system keeps it out of salable stock and optionally tracks it for return to supplier.
- **Supplier Management:** Each **Supplier** has a record with terms (e.g., payment 30 days, preferred currency) and perhaps a score. The system can track statistics like on-time delivery rate by supplier. This is more data for insight but no strict rule unless set (e.g., could block new PO to a blacklisted supplier).
- **Costing Impacts:** If an item is inventory, its valuation can include additional costs like shipping or customs. TOSS allows landing cost allocation (prorating freight, etc., into item cost) though small businesses might use a simpler approach (just record such costs as expenses). By rule, if using the feature, every landed cost must be allocated fully to avoid cost discrepancies.
- **Budget Awareness:** If the business has expense budgets (not common in micro businesses), TOSS can warn when a purchase will exceed a budget (e.g., monthly purchasing budget for a category).
- **Required Fields:** Ensure key info is filled - you cannot submit a PO without a supplier, or a receipt without items and quantities, etc. If using taxes, tax template or rates should be selected to compute tax on purchase.

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:** Key DocTypes in Buying:

- **Supplier:** Master for suppliers (Name, default currency, payment terms, contact details). It can also have a credit limit or an indicator if the supplier is also a customer (some businesses buy and sell from each other).
- **Item (Purchase Info):** In the Item master, fields like default supplier, last purchase rate, and re-order level are maintained. These inform procurement decisions.
- **Material Request:** Fields - requested items (item code, quantity, required by date), request type (purchase or stock transfer), and status (Draft, Approved, Ordered, etc.). Often the first step in a workflow, can be skipped for direct POs.
- **Request for Quotation & Supplier Quotation:** RFQ is typically an invitation; in TOSS we might simplify by directly entering Supplier Quotations. **Supplier Quotation** fields - linked RFQ (if any), supplier, quotation date, items with quoted rates and any terms (delivery time, etc.). Status (Open, Selected, Rejected).
- **Purchase Order:** Fields - Supplier, order date, expected date, items (with quantities, rates, amount, tax breakdown), terms and conditions, and status (Draft/Submitted/Completed). It also has a linkage to Material Requests or Quotation if applicable.
- **Purchase Receipt:** Fields - Supplier, receipt date, items received (with quantity received vs ordered, and any rejected quantity), warehouse, and if applicable batch numbers. Has a checkbox "Update Stock" (always true in this context) and status (Draft/Submitted).
- **Purchase Invoice:** Fields - Supplier, posting date, due date, items (with quantities, rates, amount which can be fetched from PO or receipt), taxes & charges (e.g., VAT), total, and status (Unpaid/Paid). Also includes a field for Supplier Invoice No. to record the vendor's reference. If this invoice is linked to a Purchase Receipt, the system can auto-reconcile quantities.
- **Payment Entry (for Purchase):** Fields - Supplier, payment date, mode (cash/bank), amount, and references (which invoice or advance it's for).

**User Interface & Experience:** The Buying module is designed to make replenishment easy rather than bureaucratic. On the TOSS dashboard, a shop owner might see a **"Low Stock Items"** indicator. By clicking it, they access a Reorder screen listing all items below their reorder level (with current stock and recommended order quantity). From there, Naledi (for example) could tick which items to order and click **"Make Purchase Order"**, and TOSS will draft a consolidated PO for those items to their default suppliers. This one-click replenishment is crucial for users who are not procurement experts.

When creating a **Purchase Order** manually, the form auto-suggests past order quantities and last prices: if you ordered 100 units of cement last time at R50, when you add cement this time, it might show R50 as rate and highlight "last ordered 2 weeks ago, 100 units" for context. This helps in negotiations and decisions. If multiple suppliers supply the item, TOSS could show a dropdown of supplier options or the last supplier used.

TOSS uses simple labels; for instance, instead of "Purchase Invoice", menus might show **"Supplier Bill"** to be more immediately understandable. The Purchase Invoice form might have a big toggle for "Is Paid?" if paying immediately, simplifying use for cash-on-delivery scenarios (checking it could auto-create the payment entry behind scenes).

On mobile, the forms for PO and receipt are streamlined: e.g., for a receipt, you select the PO, and it loads all items with ordered vs. you just adjust any that weren't fully delivered or are rejected. This reduces typing. There's also a feature to snap a photo of the supplier's delivery note or invoice using the device camera and attach it, so records are kept (useful for later dispute resolution).

**Offline Capabilities:** Procurement generally assumes some connectivity (to communicate with suppliers or update stock), but TOSS still supports offline use in parts of the workflow. For example, if a delivery is being checked in a storeroom with poor signal, the storekeeper can still open the last known PO on their device (cached) and enter the **Purchase Receipt** details offline. The data (new receipt, any rejections) will sync once back online, updating stock then. Creation of new POs offline is possible (say the owner at a trade show writes a quick PO on a tablet without net), and it will sync later and can then be emailed. The system queues outgoing RFQ emails until connectivity returns. One have to be cautious with offline ordering that pricing info might not be up-to-date without sync (TOSS caches the last known price lists per supplier).

Crucially, **Item and Supplier lists** are cached locally, so selecting products or suppliers offline is seamless. If there's an attempt to order an item that was newly added on server while the device was offline, the device wouldn't know - but that's an edge case. As a safeguard, TOSS might warn on sync if an item code on the PO was unrecognized (perhaps typed incorrectly offline), allowing correction.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Thabo runs a small convenience shop. Every Sunday, he reviews stock to place orders for the week. Using the Buying module, he checks the_ _Reorder Suggestions_\*. TOSS shows: "Flour - 5 kg in stock (reorder level 20 kg) → Suggest order 15 kg; Cooking Oil - 2 bottles in stock (reorder 10) → Suggest order 8; Sugar - 0 in stock (reorder 10) → Suggest order 10" and so on. Thabo selects all three and clicks "Create Purchase Orders". Since Flour and Oil are from Supplier A, and Sugar from Supplier B in his item setup, TOSS actually creates two POs automatically: one for Supplier A listing flour and oil, and one for Supplier B for sugar.

He opens each PO draft, double-checks it, and then Submits. TOSS emails the POs to the respective suppliers (because their records have email contacts). Supplier A replies via phone confirming availability but at a slightly higher price for oil due to market changes. Thabo edits the PO in TOSS, updating the oil price (the system highlights the change and will reflect it on the invoice later).

On Monday, deliveries arrive. For Supplier A's delivery, he opens the PO on his phone, and presses **Receive Items**. The app brings up the Purchase Receipt screen with flour 15kg and oil 8 bottles pre-filled. He counts and finds everything correct. He submits the receipt, which immediately updates his stock for flour and oil (so sales people can see they're in stock now). Similarly, Supplier B delivers sugar 10 bags; he creates a Purchase Receipt from that PO as well.

Now he has two Purchase Invoices to record (the bills). For simplicity, Thabo opens the **Accounts Payable** section where he sees "2 Unpaid Supplier Bills" (the system can auto-create draft invoices from receipts). He opens each: they're already populated with the items and amounts from the PO/receipt. He notices the invoice from Supplier A also charged a R50 delivery fee that wasn't on the PO. He adds a line "Delivery Fee" (set as a non-stock expense item) to the Purchase Invoice. He then saves and submits it. This increases the amount payable accordingly.

Thabo has 30-day terms, so he doesn't pay immediately. TOSS now shows these invoices under "Bills to Pay". At month end, Thabo goes to the Payment interface, selects all open supplier invoices, and records a single payment for each that he is making via bank transfer. This closes them out. If he short-paid any (maybe disputing something), TOSS would keep the balance open.

Throughout this process, TOSS enforced that he couldn't receive more items than ordered, and when he entered that extra delivery fee, it properly categorized it as an expense. All the while, his inventory was kept correct - his staff saw sugar restocked in the system the moment he submitted the receipt, so they could start selling it. And by using the suggestions, Thabo ensured he ordered enough to meet demand but not overstock. The Buying module saved him time and prevented the common issue of forgetting to order something and then losing sales.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** The Buying module benefits from AI in several ways. **Automated reordering** is a primary feature: the AI monitors stock levels and sales velocity to generate smart reorder suggestions beyond simple minimum levels. For example, it might notice that certain items sell faster toward month-end (maybe when customers have salaries), so it suggests a larger reorder in that week and smaller in mid-month. It will also incorporate supplier lead times - if a supplier usually takes 1 week to deliver, AI can nudge the reorder earlier than a naive threshold trigger would[\[7\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L110-L118)[\[28\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L114-L117). Essentially, it becomes an intelligent planner: _"Based on current stock and sales trend, order 5 more crates of soda now to avoid running out by Friday."_

AI also keeps an eye on **supplier performance and pricing**. It can analyze purchase history to alert if a supplier's prices have crept up significantly or if they frequently deliver short. For example, _"Supplier B has increased sugar price 5% above average market price_[_\[27\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L110-L115)_. You might want to compare alternatives."_ If multiple suppliers exist for an item, AI could recommend splitting orders for best pricing or reliability.

For payment management, AI might watch cash flow and suggest optimal timing for purchases: _"Your cash is low and you have a big payment due next week; consider deferring non-urgent purchases."_ Conversely, it could spot opportunities like early payment discounts: _"Supplier A offers 2% off for early payment - paying now could save R100 (and your cash balance is healthy)."_

Another aspect is **inventory quality**: AI can tie into quality data (if available) to suggest not buying from suppliers who had quality issues, or highlight if an item often gets returned (maybe indicating a supplier problem).

During purchase order entry, AI can assist by suggesting likely order quantities based on past frequency (_"You typically buy 10 bottles of oil monthly, last purchase was 4 weeks ago"_) and even flagging if you're ordering an abnormal amount relative to sales (_"This order is 3x your usual quantity for rice - check if this is intended"_). This kind of insight helps avoid both overstocking and under-ordering.

**Collaborative Network Features:** On the network level, the Buying module unlocks one of the network's biggest advantages: **group purchasing power**. Multiple small businesses can combine their orders to negotiate bulk rates from suppliers. TOSS supports this by enabling **Group Purchase Orders**. For instance, five independent spaza shops in the network could agree to do a joint procurement of a wholesale lot of cooking oil. Through the collaborative layer, they can use TOSS to create a single **Group Purchase Order** that aggregates all their needs (100 bottles total, where each shop's contribution is marked)[\[8\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L120-L124). This PO is then sent to the supplier with the network's collective branding or via a central coordinating entity. When the goods arrive, TOSS will split the received quantities into each shop's individual Purchase Receipts (e.g., Shop A gets 20, Shop B 30, etc., summing to the 100) and their respective payables. Each shop benefits from the lower bulk price, and the network ensures fair distribution and accounting of who owes what.

The Collaborative Network also allows **supplier relationship management** at a group level. The network might maintain a shared supplier rating system within TOSS - if one member logs a serious late delivery or bad quality from a supplier, that info can be optionally shared (with moderation) to other members, so everyone is aware. This fosters a sort of community-reviewed supplier list, pushing suppliers to maintain good service to not lose the entire network's business. Additionally, the network could designate certain suppliers as preferred or negotiate contract prices on behalf of all members. Those negotiated price lists can be loaded into TOSS so that every member's Buying module automatically uses the better rates.

Another feature is **shared warehouse or logistics**: if the network jointly orders in bulk, they might bring goods into a central warehouse then distribute. TOSS can facilitate this by, for example, creating an internal **Transfer Order** from the central warehouse to each shop after the group purchase is received (essentially treating the network's hub as a supplier to the shops with zero markup). The system can trigger these transfers once the group PO is received, making the process seamless for members.

Through collaboration, even tasks like procurement planning can be shared. One experienced member or a hired procurement officer could oversee generating purchase plans for common commodities (like staple foods, airtime stock, etc.) and TOSS can present that plan to each member for approval. This way, less experienced shop owners get the benefit of expert planning.

In summary, the Buying module in a network turns the many small orders into one powerful order[\[8\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L120-L124), reduces costs via bulk discounts, and strengthens negotiating power and information symmetry with suppliers - leveling the playing field between tiny township businesses and large retailers.

## CRM (Customer Relationship Management Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The CRM module focuses on managing leads, customer interactions, and sales opportunities, serving as the pre-sales and client relationship hub that feeds into the Selling module. It helps businesses **capture leads, nurture opportunities, and maintain customer relationships** in an organized way[\[13\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=The%20CRM%20module%20in%20ERPNext,interactions%20and%20streamline%20sales%20processes). For township and rural businesses, CRM ensures that potential customers (whether walk-ins showing interest, referrals, or inquiries via phone/WhatsApp) are recorded and followed up, so no opportunity is lost due to forgetfulness or disorganization. It also centralizes customer contact info and interaction history, which is valuable for building loyalty and repeat sales.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Lead Capture:** Record new **Leads** (potential customers or inquiries) with basic info: name, contact number, maybe how they heard about the business (referral source). A lead could be someone who showed interest in a product but hasn't bought yet, or someone who filled a "contact us" form on the website. TOSS CRM provides a quick Lead form to fill in these details[\[31\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=,to%20ensure%20effective%20customer%20engagement).
- **Lead Qualification & Follow-ups:** Set the status of leads (e.g., Open, Contacted, Converted, or Lost). Schedule follow-up actions for each lead - e.g., a task or reminder to call them back next week. The CRM can list all leads needing action on a given day. It also allows logging call notes or meeting notes, so each lead's timeline shows every touchpoint (call made, WhatsApp sent, etc.).
- **Opportunity Management:** When a lead expresses concrete interest (say requests a quote or shows intent to buy), convert that lead into an **Opportunity**. An Opportunity records the potential deal: which product or service they're interested in, estimated value, and expected closing date[\[31\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=,to%20ensure%20effective%20customer%20engagement). It goes through stages (e.g., Initial Inquiry → Quotation Sent → Negotiation → Won/Lost).
- **Quotation & Conversion:** The CRM links seamlessly to Selling - you can create a **Quotation** directly from an Opportunity once details are firm. That quotation then moves through the sales cycle as described in Selling. The CRM Opportunity gets updated when a quote is sent or an order is won, so you can analyze conversion rates.
- **Customer Management:** Once a lead or opportunity is won, it becomes a **Customer** in the system (if not already). The CRM module then overlaps with customer service: it holds contact details (phone, email), multiple addresses, and a communications log for each customer[\[85\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=forecast%20potential%20revenue.%20,customer%20behavior%2C%20and%20CRM%20effectiveness). It also shows all deals (orders, invoices) linked to that customer, effectively providing a 360° view.
- **Activity Tracking:** Manage all interactions with both leads and existing customers. This includes scheduling calls or visits (which can integrate with a calendar), sending emails (if email is set up, TOSS can send and capture replies), and capturing any customer requests or complaints to hand off to Support if needed.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** CRM provides simple reports like Lead Funnel (how many leads converted to opportunities and then to sales), or lists of customers by last interaction date (to identify those who haven't been contacted recently). This helps prioritize outreach.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Lead De-duplication:** When entering a new lead, the system can warn if a similar contact already exists (by matching phone or email). This avoids duplicate entries for the same person, ensuring all info is in one place.
- **Mandatory Follow-up:** Optionally, the business might enforce that every new lead must have a next follow-up date set. This prevents leads from languishing without attention. TOSS can prompt: "Set a follow-up reminder" when saving a lead.
- **Opportunity Probability & Forecast:** Each opportunity can have a probability of closing (maybe auto-set by stage or manual). The system ensures total forecast values are calculated, but this is more advisory. It might, however, flag opportunities with closing dates that have passed without update.
- **Customer Status:** If a customer is marked inactive or blacklisted (perhaps due to bad debt), the CRM could warn or block new opportunities or quotes for them without managerial override.
- **Data Privacy:** Keep customer personal info secure - for example, if multiple staff use the system, one might restrict who can export or see full contact lists (though in a small biz, likely one user or a couple owners have access anyway).
- **Lead Aging:** If a lead hasn't been contacted in, say, 14 days, the system might escalate it as "cold" or change status. This can be configured or simply managed via reports.

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:**

- **Lead:** Fields - Lead Name, Contact info (phone, email), Source (how lead was found: referral, web, walk-in, etc.), Interested Item/Service (optional quick note), Lead Owner (if multiple employees handling leads), Status (Open, Contacted, Converted, Do Not Contact). May also capture Company name if it's a business lead.
- **Opportunity:** Fields - linked Customer/Lead, Opportunity Type (sales, project, etc.), Items of interest (item and quantity, or a general description of need), Estimated value, Expected closing date, Stage (Qualification, Proposal, etc.), Probability (%), and Opportunity Owner. Could also link to a specific Quotation when one is made.
- **Customer:** (Shared with Selling) - aside from master data, used in CRM to store segment info or loyalty program ID, etc.
- **Contact & Address:** Separate DocTypes that can link to Lead or Customer. Contact fields - name, phone, mobile, email. Address fields - address lines, city, etc., plus whether billing/shipping for customers.
- **Communication/Interaction:** The system logs communications as timeline entries. These may not be a separate doctype user fills (except for sending emails or adding a comment), but behind the scenes, a **Communication** entity stores the content of an email or a call log with a link to Lead/Customer.
- **Todo/Reminder:** Internally tasks or events for follow-ups. Possibly integrated with a calendar. Fields - description, due date, linked Lead/Opportunity, assigned to user.
- **Campaign:** If doing marketing, one could tag leads or opportunities with a Campaign name (e.g., "Easter Promo 2025"), to evaluate campaign effectiveness. Campaign could be its own doctype with start/end and type (SMS blast, radio ad, etc.).

**User Interface & Experience:** The CRM views are centered around people and companies. For instance, the app might have a **Leads list** that shows each lead's name, status, and a colored indicator if a follow-up is due or overdue. Tapping a lead opens a **Lead Details** page showing contact info at top and a timeline of interactions (e.g., "Jan 5: Called - interested in pricing, follow-up on Jan 10"). There's a prominent button to **"Convert to Opportunity"** or **"Create Quotation"** if the lead becomes hot.

The **Opportunity Kanban** is a useful UI feature: opportunities can be visualized in columns by stage (New, Quotation Sent, Negotiation, Won, Lost). On a tablet or laptop, user can drag an opportunity card from one stage to another as it progresses. On mobile, perhaps a dropdown to change stage. This gives a quick overview of the sales pipeline.

CRM has a **Today's Agenda** sort of view: a combined list of all tasks, calls, and follow-ups due today or soon. So when a business owner starts the day, they might see: "Call Ms. Dlamini (lead) - due today", "Follow up quote QUO-0004 with Joe (opportunity) - due yesterday (overdue)", etc. Each entry can be tapped to update or mark complete. This ensures no customer is forgotten.

When creating a communication (like sending an email or SMS from within TOSS), the UI is simple: select a template or type a message, and send. The text is automatically logged under that contact's timeline. For emails, if integrated, replies could route back into the timeline as well.

In terms of language, TOSS CRM uses friendly terms: e.g., "New Friend" or "New Contact" could be synonyms for leads in some localized versions (or at least tooltips). And instead of "Opportunity", sometimes "Deal" or "Potential Sale" might be used in the UI, which is more intuitive for small business users. We assume a bit of business understanding though, so "Lead" and "Opportunity" can be kept if explained once.

**Offline Capabilities:** Much of CRM can work offline as well. If a salesperson is out in the field meeting people, they can add new leads offline on their phone. Those leads will sync to the central system later. The app caches recent leads, opportunities, and customers, so one can pull up a customer's phone number or address offline when visiting them. Logging an interaction (say, after a meeting, writing summary notes) can be done offline too - it will timestamp and sync later.

One limitation offline is sending communications - if you draft an email offline, the app will queue it and send once connected (ensuring no leads get an email at a random time, the system might only send during business hours or upon next connection). Also, if multiple team members handle CRM, offline use by one might lead to some sync conflicts like two people editing the same lead details - but given likely usage, this is minimal.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Sibusiso offers solar panel installations in rural areas. At a local farmers' market, he meets numerous people interested in solar solutions. Using TOSS CRM on his phone, he quickly adds each_ _Lead_\*: e.g., "Emily Nkosi - 5km out of town, wants quote for borehole solar pump - 082xxxx" and "Green Village Co-op - interested in solar for community center - 010xxxx". He assigns a follow-up date for each next week.

Back in the office (or home), he opens TOSS on his laptop. In the **Leads** view, he sees those new entries. He calls Emily on Monday as scheduled (the app reminded him that morning). In the lead's timeline, he clicks "Log Call" and notes "Discussed needs, site visit set for Wed". He also moves her status to **Contacted**. After the site visit Wednesday, he realizes it's a serious prospect: he converts Emily from Lead to **Opportunity** right in the app, specifying "Solar Pump 1.5kW" as the item of interest and an estimated value of R30k. He then uses TOSS Selling to craft a **Quotation** and sends it to Emily.

Meanwhile, the **Green Village Co-op** lead emailed some specifications. Through TOSS's integrated email (or by logging manually), Sibusiso records that on their lead timeline. He schedules a meeting. That lead might take longer, but the system ensures he won't forget it - it's always listed in his open leads.

Emily accepts the quote - Sibusiso marks the Opportunity as **Won** (which also creates her as a Customer in the system). The CRM automatically records that outcome in funnel analysis. For Green Village, suppose they haven't decided for months - the system will periodically remind Sibusiso to touch base or eventually mark it inactive if cold.

Sibusiso also uses CRM for existing customers: e.g., he sets reminders to call each past client 6 months after install for a check-in (potential upsell of batteries or maintenance service). These show up in his ToDo list. When one customer, John, says he's interested in expanding his system, Sibusiso logs an **Opportunity** under John's customer record (skipping lead since John is already a customer). Now he can manage that potential repeat sale through the pipeline too.

All this data - how many leads he got, from where (say, he tags some as "Market Booth" vs "Facebook Ad"), how many converted - is available in CRM reports. He learns that 50% of the leads from market booth became opportunities, a great conversion, so he decides to do it again next month. CRM helped him systematically build and convert interest into revenue, rather than relying on scraps of paper or memory.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** AI in the CRM module serves as a virtual sales assistant and customer analyst. It can automatically prioritize leads by analyzing which are most likely to convert. For example, based on past data, it might score leads who provided detailed project info higher than those who just said "call me," and prompt Sibusiso to focus on the high-score leads first (a form of lead scoring). It also notices patterns - e.g., leads from certain sources or regions converting better - and will surface those insights: _"Leads from the weekly market have a 60% conversion rate_[_\[31\]_](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/CRM#:~:text=,to%20ensure%20effective%20customer%20engagement)_, higher than other sources. Consider investing more in that channel."_

For ongoing opportunities, the AI looks at the pipeline and can forecast sales. It might say: _"You have 5 open deals worth R50k likely closing this month (estimated from stage probabilities)."_ If it sees a lot of deals stuck in one stage for too long (e.g., quotations sent but no update in 30 days), it will gently remind: _"3 opportunities have not been updated in over a month. You may want to follow up or close them."_

The AI can also suggest **next best actions** for each opportunity. For instance: _"Opportunity Green Village Co-op has been in Negotiation for 2 weeks. Suggest offering a small discount or a financing plan to close the deal."_ It could base this on what has worked for similar past customers (pattern recognition).

When dealing with existing customers, AI watches their purchase history and interactions. It might alert: _"Customer John's energy usage is up - recommend upsell a battery upgrade."_ Or if a regular customer hasn't bought in a while: _"Client XYZ hasn't ordered in 3 months (normally monthly). Consider reaching out with a promotion."_ This ties CRM to Selling and even Support, as it uses holistic data to prompt retention moves.

Moreover, AI can help draft personalized communications. For example, when sending a follow-up email to a lead, it might suggest a tailored message: _"Hi Emily, since we last spoke, I thought you'd be interested in our new pump model that fits borehole setups like yours..."_ - saving Sibusiso time crafting emails while adding a professional touch.

**Collaborative Network Features:** In a network context, CRM can be extended to **referral sharing and collective customer insights**. For example, network members could agree to refer leads to each other: if one gets an inquiry they cannot service (out of their area or expertise), they log it in TOSS and flag it as available for referral. Other network members see these shared leads (perhaps in a special communal lead pool) and can pick them up. The system can then track referral fees or simply note the source. This way, a lead never goes to waste - the network increases the chance someone serves that customer, keeping business within the community.

The network might also maintain a **shared customer blacklist** for problematic clients (with caution and legal considerations). If a customer defrauds one member (e.g., takes goods on credit and vanishes), that member could mark them, and optionally that warning is visible to others so they don't also extend credit. Conversely, a shared **loyalty program** across the network means CRM modules of different businesses might share some customer data (like a loyalty ID and points). If a customer shops at multiple network stores, their profile (name, phone) could be recognized across, with permission, so their points accumulate network-wide. TOSS could handle this by a central loyalty service that CRM of each tenant hooks into.

The network can also aggregate CRM metrics for collective insight. Without revealing individual customer info, it could show, say, common trends: _"There's growing demand for solar pumps in outskirt villages - 3 members reported similar leads."_ This can encourage members to tailor offerings accordingly or do joint marketing.

Additionally, joint marketing campaigns can be run through the network's CRM collaboration. The network could initiate a campaign (e.g., an SMS blast or flyer drop across the township) and distribute the leads it generates among members fairly (maybe by territory). TOSS could tag leads by campaign and origin, so when they flow in via a central point (like the network's website or hotline), they are routed to the appropriate local member's CRM.

Privacy is key: any sharing of customer info in the network must be consent-based and opt-in by members. TOSS provides the tools (like flags to share a lead or a customer across tenants) but the network governance decides the rules. Used wisely, these CRM collaboration features mean small businesses can act like a larger unified enterprise in customer acquisition and service - referring business to each other, recognizing customers across shops (with loyalty or just better service), and collectively learning about their customer base to improve offerings.

## Stock (Inventory Management Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The Stock (Inventory) module enables businesses to **track and control their inventory** of products and materials across one or multiple locations. It maintains item master data, current stock levels, and records every stock movement (stock in, stock out, transfers) with appropriate valuation. This ensures that small businesses know exactly what they have in stock, what is running low, and can avoid losses due to stockouts or overstocking[\[23\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=The%20Stock%20or%20Inventory%20module,in%20ERPNext%20helps%20you%20to). It's tightly integrated with Purchasing, Selling, and Accounting: purchase receipts add stock, sales/deliveries reduce stock, and it provides real-time inventory values for financials.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Item Catalog & Units:** Define all **Items** that are kept in stock with a unique code and key details (unit of measure, default buying/selling rate, whether it's batch-managed or has serial numbers, etc.). Organize items by groups or categories for easier reporting. For example, in a spaza shop, item groups might be Beverages, Snacks, Cleaning Supplies, etc.
- **Stock In (Receipt):** Whenever new stock comes in, either from a supplier (via **Purchase Receipt**) or other sources (e.g., an opening stock entry, or manufacturing output), it's recorded. This increases the quantity on hand in the specified warehouse. The system logs the date, source document (like PO or production batch), and who received it.
- **Stock Out (Delivery/Consumption):** When stock leaves - typically through a **Delivery Note** for a sale, or through an **Stock Adjustment** for things like wastage, spoilage, or giving samples - it's recorded and deducts from on-hand quantity. All such movements can be captured by reason codes (sold, damaged, expired, etc.).
- **Stock Transfers:** If a business has multiple locations or even just storage vs. storefront, use **Stock Transfer** entries to move goods from one warehouse to another (e.g., from back storage to the shop floor). TOSS will decrease stock in source and increase in destination accordingly, ensuring total inventory remains same.
- **Stock Reconciliation (Physical Count):** Periodically, perform a **stock take**. Using TOSS, generate a list of items and count them in person. Then use a **Stock Reconciliation** entry to adjust the system counts to match physical counts, accounting for any discrepancies (shrinkage or unrecorded receipts). This posts any difference to an appropriate expense (inventory loss) or adjustment account.
- **Batch and Serial Number Tracking:** For items that need it (e.g., medicine with expiry dates or electronics with unique serials), the module allows assigning incoming stock to **Batch numbers** (with manufacturing/expiry dates) or **Serial numbers** (one per unit). All out movements then require specifying which batch/serial is being delivered or consumed. This helps in quality control and warranty tracking.
- **Inventory Valuation & Ledger:** Behind the scenes, every stock move updates the **Stock Ledger** (quantities per item per warehouse over time) and the **Stock Balance**. The module also calculates inventory value using methods like FIFO or Moving Average by default. For accounting, it generates accounting entries for stock movements if integrated with perpetual inventory (inventory account and cost of goods sold) so that the books always match the physical stock value[\[86\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=,Provide%20valuation%20of%20each%20product).
- **Alerts & Reports:** The module can trigger alerts for low stock (when falling below re-order level as noted in item). There are also reports like Stock Balance (current qty and value of each item), Stock Ledger (detailed movements log), and Ageing (which batches are nearing expiry or items not moving for long).

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **No Negative Stock (configurable):** By default, TOSS will prevent transactions from taking an item's stock below zero unless explicitly allowed. For instance, you can't deliver 5 units if only 3 are in stock - it will throw an error. (Some businesses allow "virtual negative stock" if they want to invoice even if stock not updated yet, but it's an option).
- **First-In-First-Out (FIFO):** If using batch/expiry, or if configured for FIFO costing, the system will consume older stock first by default when you do not specify a batch (or it can auto-suggest which batch to use). This ensures proper rotation (especially for perishables, sell oldest first) and correct cost calculation.
- **Mandatory Fields:** On stock entries, fields like Item, Quantity, and Warehouse are mandatory. If the item has serial numbers, you must provide those serials equal to the quantity. If batched, you must pick a batch or create a new one when receiving.
- **Stock Freeze (Period Lock):** Optionally, an admin can "freeze" stock books as of a certain date (say year-end) so that no backdated entries can be made before that date without permission. This preserves historical inventory integrity after financial closing.
- **Valuation Consistency:** Every stock entry that affects value (buying, selling, adjustment) must have a proper rate/valuation. If an item is received without a purchase rate (like opening balance load), the system requires input of a value. If inventory is managed in multiple currencies or has additional costs, the system ensures conversion and inclusion of those costs if directed.
- **Integration Hooks:** When a Delivery Note is submitted, the system automatically makes the stock deduction and (if perpetual inventory) triggers the accounting for COGS at that moment[\[87\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=,product). Similarly, a Purchase Receipt triggers an increase and provisional asset of stock. These are enforced to keep sub-ledger and GL in sync.
- **Expiration Control:** For batch-tracked items, TOSS can disallow selling if expired (if configured). At minimum it flags warnings for near-expiry items in reports. Also, during stock reconciliation, if user marks some expired and removes them, those go out as scrap adjustments.
- **UOM Conversions:** If items are purchased in one unit (case of 24) and sold in another (bottles), the system maintains a conversion factor. It will validate that transactions use allowed UOMs and convert stock correctly (e.g., buying 1 case adds 24 bottles to stock).

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:**

- **Item:** (shared with Selling/Buying) - Fields relevant to stock: Item Code, Item Name, Stock UOM, whether maintains stock, default warehouse, re-order level, valuation method (if item-specific), whether batch/serial tracking is enabled, and an Item Group classification.
- **Warehouse:** Represents a stock location (could be a physical room or just a virtual partition). Hierarchical (a store can have sub-warehouses like "Front Shelf" vs "Back Store" if needed). Key fields: Warehouse Name, Parent (for hierarchy), and possibly an address or location description.
- **Stock Ledger Entry:** Internal table logging every quantity change with: Item, Warehouse, Date/Time, Voucher Type (e.g., Delivery Note), Voucher No, Qty In, Qty Out, Balance Qty, Valuation Rate, Balance Value after the entry[\[23\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=The%20Stock%20or%20Inventory%20module,in%20ERPNext%20helps%20you%20to). (This is more backend, surfaced via reports).
- **Stock Entry:** General doctype for stock movements that are not sales or purchase. It has a purpose (Material Issue, Material Receipt, Material Transfer, Repack, etc.). Fields: Purpose, From Warehouse (if issue/transfer), To Warehouse (if receipt/transfer), Items table (Item, Qty, Source and Target warehouses per row if split, Serial/Batch details, and maybe an Expense Account for issues). This is used for adjustments and transfers.
- **Batch:** Fields - Batch ID, Item, Manufacture Date, Expiry Date, and current quantity (computed as sum of that batch across warehouses, or separate per warehouse in some implementations). Batches are created on purchase receipt or manufacturing output.
- **Serial No:** Fields - Serial Number, Item, Warehouse, Status (Available/Delivered/Returned/etc.), and warranty expiry or other custom fields if needed. A serial record moves with stock movements.
- **Stock Reconciliation:** A document to adjust stock to a physical count. Fields: Posting date, list of items with current recounted quantity, and system computes difference. On submission, it posts those differences to ledger and relevant accounts.
- **Reorder Level (in Item or separate):** Fields - for each item (and optionally per warehouse) a minimum level and a reorder quantity. Could be stored in Item or a child doctype like "Item Reorder". TOSS uses these for suggestions.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Stock module in TOSS often works behind the scenes (adjusting to sales/purchases), but when used directly, it provides clear, action-oriented interfaces. For example, an **Inventory Dashboard** might show at a glance: Total Stock Value, Number of Items in stock, and Alerts like "3 items below re-order level"[\[23\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=The%20Stock%20or%20Inventory%20module,in%20ERPNext%20helps%20you%20to). Tapping an alert could take the user to a filtered list of those items with buttons to "Reorder" (linking to Buying) or to view details.

The **Item Master** form is streamlined; many fields like valuation method or accounts might be hidden under an "Advanced" section for simplicity, letting the user mostly fill in name, default price, and stock tracking options. For items with serial numbers, the item form can show a list of all serials and their status for quick reference.

Day-to-day stock operations often happen in the background via other modules (e.g., selling auto issues stock), but for manual tasks: - The **Stock Transfer** UI can present a simple flow: "From Warehouse \[dropdown\] → To Warehouse \[dropdown\]", then a table to scan or select items and quantities to move. This could be made even simpler by supporting a barcode scan mode where a staff scans each item leaving the storeroom; the app increments those in a list, then they confirm transfer to front. - The **Stock Adjustment** (Material Issue/Receipt) UI might ask for a reason: e.g., "Write-off / Shrinkage" or "New stock found". For a write-off, it might prompt for a short note ("e.g., broken bottles") to encourage good record-keeping. - There's also a **Quick Stock Balance Lookup**: in TOSS, perhaps a search bar where typing an item name shows current stock on hand (and maybe incoming POs). This is useful when a customer asks if something is in stock or to decide to reorder. This quick lookup can be accessible from selling screens too.

On mobile, scanning is a theme: TOSS could allow using the device camera as a barcode scanner in stock entry forms, accelerating counts or transfers. The interface uses large, easy buttons for actions like "Receive Stock" or "Count Stock" to cater to less tech-savvy staff.

**Offline Capabilities:** Inventory data is cached to allow basic lookup offline - e.g., a salesperson can see current stock even if connection drops (from the last sync). Doing a **Stock Count** in a warehouse with no connectivity is a prime offline scenario: the staff can use TOSS offline to mark down quantities of each item they count. The app would store these and later, when online, convert it into a Stock Reconciliation entry to adjust records. If a tablet is used, they might do the whole reconciliation offline and sync the final numbers.

Likewise, if a delivery is being made offline (POS sale or manual issue for charity, etc.), the stock will decrement in the local app and mark pending sync. TOSS's sync logic ensures FIFO or batch selection is consistent - e.g., it might reserve specific batch numbers for an offline delivery based on what the local app last knew as available, and when syncing if it finds a discrepancy (maybe that batch was consumed by another user), it will intelligently adjust or flag for user intervention.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Maria runs a small clothing boutique. Every few weeks, she does a full inventory count. Traditionally this was pen-and-paper, but with TOSS Stock module on her phone, it's become easier. One Sunday when the shop is closed, she opens TOSS and chooses_ _Stock Take Mode_\* for her "Main Shop" warehouse. As she scans the barcode of each clothing item on the rack, the app matches it to an item and prompts for quantity. For unique pieces, quantity is 1; for common items like socks, she scans a sock tag and enters 30 (pairs). She works section by section. Because her internet is spotty inside the container that houses her boutique, the app is working offline. It's saving her count as she goes.

By the end, Maria has counted everything. She reviews the offline data: the app shows her count vs. what the system expected for each item, highlighting differences. For example, it expected 32 pairs of socks but she counted 30. She confirms to create adjustments for the differences. Later that day when she gets network, she opens TOSS and it syncs the **Stock Reconciliation**: inventory levels for socks are brought down by 2, and those 2 are posted as an "Inventory Loss (Shrinkage)" expense. Now her system stock matches reality.

In daily operation, Maria uses the Stock module mostly indirectly. When she sells an item via POS, TOSS automatically reduces the stock. If an item gets damaged (say a shirt gets a stain), she uses the **Material Issue** function: selects "Damaged Goods" reason, the item, and quantity 1 - this immediately writes off that piece from stock and records the loss. When new inventory arrives from her suppliers, she either uses **Purchase Receipt** (in Buying) which updates stock, or if it's consignment stock without a PO, she can directly do a **Material Receipt** in Stock module for those items with a note "Consignment from Supplier X".

Maria also appreciates the low-stock alerts: she set re-order levels on fast-moving items. If ladies' t-shirts drop below 5, TOSS highlights it. One day, a customer asks for an out-of-stock design; using her phone, Maria quickly checks TOSS and sees it's indeed 0 in stock, but also sees she has 10 on order coming next week (because a Purchase Order in the system is pending) - she can confidently inform the customer when to come back[\[88\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=The%20Stock%20module%20is%20tightly,Purchase%2C%20Manufacturing%20and%20Accounting%20modules). This kind of information at her fingertips improves her professionalism and reduces missed sales.

The Stock reports in TOSS also taught Maria that some products just don't move. By running an **Ageing report**, she found certain dress styles sitting for 6 months. She decided to discount them to free up cash. Without TOSS tracking each item's age and quantity, she might have overlooked those old items. Now her inventory is leaner and more tuned to what customers want.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** AI supercharges the Stock module by analyzing usage patterns and optimizing inventory management. One key feature is **demand forecasting**: the AI looks at past sales trends (seasonality, growth) and suggests how much stock to hold or reorder. For example, it might tell Maria: _"Based on sales in the last 3 months, you should keep at least 40 pairs of socks in stock (current 30 is likely to stockout)_[_\[37\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L510-L514)_."_ Conversely, for slow-movers: _"Dresses Category B has 20 pieces in stock but average monthly sales are 2 - consider reducing stock or running a promotion."_

AI-driven **reorder suggestions** go beyond static reorder levels. It can dynamically adjust reorder points by learning patterns like higher demand on weekends or specific events. It also takes into account lead time: _"Item X takes 2 weeks to deliver and you sell 5/week, so reorder when you hit 10 left (instead of the default 5) to avoid stockout."_ These suggestions appear in the Reorder report or as alerts[\[37\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L510-L514).

For **stock optimization**, the AI can identify dead stock (items not sold in X days) and prompt actions: _"You have 15 items not sold in 100 days - consider marking them clearance."_ It can also highlight potential theft or shrinkage issues: _"Your last 3 stock counts showed consistent losses of similar items (like 2-3 units of brand Y missing each time) - possible pattern of shrinkage."_ That might lead Maria to improve security or check staff handling.

AI also assists in **valuation and cost**: For instance, if costs of an item are rising, it could warn to adjust pricing or negotiate with supplier. It might say _"The last purchase price for Item Z increased by 15%. This will reduce your margin if selling at old price."_ so Maria can react by raising prices or finding alternatives.

Another clever insight is **spoilage prediction** (for perishable goods). If some items have expiry dates recorded, AI can look at sales velocity and tell you if you're on track to sell them before expiry or not. E.g., _"Milk Batch 20230401 will expire in 10 days, and you still have 20 units. At current daily sales (2/day) you will have ~0-5 unsold by expiry. Consider a discount to boost sales_[_\[37\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L510-L514)_."_

For multi-location businesses or the network, AI can suggest **stock redistribution**: _"Warehouse A has excess of Item P (100 units, 3 months of stock) while Warehouse B is low (2 days of stock). Suggest transferring 50 units from A to B."_

**Collaborative Network Features:** Inventory collaboration in the network layer opens up possibilities like **stock sharing** and **group inventory visibility**. For example, network members can opt into a system where they can see if a nearby shop has an item in stock that they ran out of. This is facilitated through TOSS by each shop's Stock module sharing some data (perhaps just item availability and quantity) in a communal lookup. So if a customer comes to Shop A and an item is out, the owner can quickly check the network stock and say "Try Shop B on Main Street, they have it." This improves customer service and keeps the sale within the network (the customer might have otherwise gone to a big supermarket).

Taking it further, the network could establish **stock pools** for certain goods. For instance, a group of shops might collectively maintain a central buffer stock of certain fast-moving items. TOSS would represent this as a central warehouse (belonging to the network or a lead member) that each shop can draw from. The Stock module's transfer capabilities then handle requests: when Shop A is low, they create a stock transfer request from Central to A. This could even be automated by AI triggers (like a central inventory system that sees Shop A hit threshold and prompts a replenishment from central). Such pooling helps smaller shops handle spikes in demand without individually holding huge safety stocks - the network buffer absorbs the variability.

Another collaborative aspect is **joint inventory financing**: sometimes networks get inventory on consignment or credit from a supplier as a group. The Stock module can mark those items such that when they sell at each shop, it records liability back to the supplier. For example, a supplier might stock 100 units across 5 shops (20 each) but only charge for what sells. TOSS can track this by item and location, and a network coordinator can see in aggregate how much has sold and needs to be paid for. This is complex but doable - effectively multi-tenant inventory with a shared ownership model.

Moreover, the network can perform **collective inventory analysis**: see which products are most popular across the entire network, and share that info with members or use it to negotiate better wholesale deals. The Stock module data from all members can feed into a central dashboard (without exposing individual sensitive info like exact stock levels per shop unless needed). For example, _"Network X sold 5000 loaves of bread this week in total_[_\[86\]_](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v12/user/manual/en/stock#:~:text=,Provide%20valuation%20of%20each%20product)_. It seems bread demand is rising 10% week-over-week consistently."_ This might prompt the network to coordinate with bakeries for assured supply or volume discounts.

Finally, in terms of **disaster recovery**, if one member faces a shortage or emergency (say a storage issue ruined their stock), the network inventory visibility and solidarity allows others to pitch in. They could rapidly transfer stock to that member to keep them running. TOSS would handle those inter-company transfers and any financial settlements (like selling at cost to the peer).

In essence, the Stock module at the network level transforms isolated silos of inventory into a more flexible, interlinked supply web. Businesses benefit from each other's foresight and safety stocks, reduce lost sales by directing customers within the network, and strengthen their negotiation and resilience by acting as one large inventory system with distributed nodes rather than many tiny ones.

## Accounting (Finance Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The Accounting module handles the financial backbone of the platform, recording all **financial transactions** and providing clarity on the business's financial health. It covers bookkeeping tasks such as invoicing, payments, expenses, and financial reporting. For small businesses in townships, TOSS simplifies accounting into an understandable "money in, money out, what's left" format while still maintaining rigorous double-entry records in the background[\[38\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L202-L208). The goal is to give business owners insight into profitability and cash flow without requiring them to be accounting experts.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Sales & Receivables:** Whenever a **Sales Invoice** is created in Selling (including POS invoices), it records revenue and an amount receivable from the customer[\[39\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=In%20ERPNext%2C%20accounting%20operations%20consists,of%203%20main%20transactions). If the sale is paid immediately (cash sale), the receivable is immediately settled (the system can auto-create a Payment entry or mark invoice as paid). Outstanding invoices remain in Accounts Receivable. The owner can monitor who hasn't paid and for how long. Sending payment reminders or statements can be done for overdue accounts.
- **Purchases & Payables:** Similarly, each **Purchase Invoice** (supplier bill) recorded in Buying logs an expense (or asset stock increase) and an amount payable to the supplier[\[89\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=,payments%2C%20credit%20and%20other%20types). Unpaid bills sit in Accounts Payable. When the business pays a supplier, a Payment entry is made which reduces that liability.
- **Expense Recording:** Not all expenses come with formal purchase invoices. For small cash expenses (transport, tea for staff, etc.), the owner can record a **Payment (Expense)** directly: choose an expense account (like "Transport Expense"), amount, and that immediately reflects in accounts (credit Cash, debit Transport Expense). TOSS provides a simple form for such outflows, essentially a Payment Entry not tied to a supplier invoice.
- **Cash Management:** The module helps manage cash on hand and bank balances. Daily cash sales can be reconciled through a **Cash Register** or **POS Closing** entry that the owner approves (as described in POS). If using multiple modes, the system tracks each (cash, mobile money, etc.). Bank deposits or withdrawals can be recorded as internal transfers between cash and bank accounts in TOSS, so that the books know where the money physically is.
- **Payroll & Other Journals:** If the business uses HR module, monthly **Payroll Journal Entries** can be posted (salary expenses, liabilities for deductions). Also, any other adjustments (like depreciation from the Assets module, or owner's drawings, etc.) reflect via **Journal Entries**. TOSS hides complexity by having dedicated forms: e.g., a Depreciation form in Assets posts a journal automatically. But an accountant user can manually create a journal for any misc. entry (like correcting an error, etc.).
- **Financial Reporting:** The module produces standard reports - **Income Statement** (Profit & Loss), **Balance Sheet**, and **Cash Flow Statement** - but in user-friendly terms. For example, an Income Statement might be labeled "Money In/Out Summary" showing total income, total expenses, and net profit ("What's left")[\[38\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L202-L208). Balance Sheet might be simplified into "What you have (Assets) and What you owe (Liabilities)". There are also **General Ledger** and **Trial Balance** reports for accountants, and possibly simplified charts for the owner (like monthly profit trend, expense breakdown pie).
- **Taxation:** If the business is VAT-registered or subject to other taxes, the module will calculate tax on sales and purchases (from invoice entries) and can generate tax reports (e.g., VAT Return). In South Africa, for instance, it could help prepare the VAT201 form values. If not registered, tax settings can be turned off for simplicity.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Double Entry Enforcement:** Every financial transaction must balance debits and credits. TOSS automates this behind scenes (e.g., when you record a sale for R100, it debits customer or cash and credits sales income R100[\[89\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=,payments%2C%20credit%20and%20other%20types)). It will not allow any posting that doesn't balance. Journal entries require equal total debits and credits.
- **Fiscal Year and Period Lock:** The system can define fiscal year periods. Once accounts for a period are finalized, you can lock it (or at least require a higher role to post in closed periods). This prevents accidental late changes that mess up reports. Often a small biz might not need this, but it's available as they grow.
- **Chart of Accounts Simplicity:** TOSS comes with a pre-set Chart of Accounts suited to small retail/service: e.g., a **Cash** account, **Bank** account, **Inventory** asset, **Accounts Receivable**, **Accounts Payable**, a few common **Expense** accounts (like Purchases, Rent, Transport, Wages), and **Sales** income accounts[\[39\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=In%20ERPNext%2C%20accounting%20operations%20consists,of%203%20main%20transactions). This is given by default. The business can add more if needed, but we avoid overwhelming them with too many categories initially. The system ensures transactions use valid accounts and segments.
- **Real-time Stock Integration:** If using perpetual inventory (which TOSS does by default to simplify things), any stock transaction posts to accounting immediately. For example, selling an inventory item not only credits sales and debits cash/receivable, but also credits inventory asset and debits cost of goods sold (COGS). This is done under the hood. Thus, the books always reflect actual stock value. The rule is you can't directly post to stock accounts via a journal - you must use stock module flows, preserving the subledger integrity.
- **Payment Matching:** A payment entry must be correctly linked to an invoice (or marked as advance). TOSS helps by providing a list of unpaid invoices to allocate payment against. It prevents common errors like applying a payment to a wrong customer's invoice.
- **Currency and Exchange:** If the business deals in multiple currencies (less likely for local small business, but possible e.g., dealing with USD wholesale or neighboring country currency), the system enforces that each invoice/payment has an explicit currency and rate. Financial reports can be in base currency with gains/losses calculated on exchange rate differences when payments settle.
- **Tax Calculations:** If taxes apply, all sales and purchase forms must have a tax template selected. The system will compute tax and keep it in a tax liability account. It validates that values are within logical range (e.g., not more tax than total, etc.). Also, if an item is tax-exempt, it ensures that's respected per item setting.
- **Owner's Equity Tracking:** If the owner injects personal money or withdraws cash for personal use, these should be recorded via journal entries (credit Owner Contribution or debit Drawings). TOSS might present a simplified interface "Record Money Taken by Owner" which behind scenes posts the journal. This ensures the business accounts clearly separate personal and business funds (important for clarity and possible future financing).
- **Audit Trail:** The Accounting module keeps an audit log of edits and deletions of transactions. E.g., if an invoice is cancelled or edited, it is logged. This maintains the trustworthiness of records, which is crucial if statements will be shown to lenders or partners.

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:**

- **Chart of Accounts:** A hierarchical structure of accounts. Each Account has fields: Account Name, Account Type (Asset/Liability/Equity/Income/Expense), possibly a parent (for grouping, e.g., all expense accounts under Expenses), and Currency if it's a foreign currency account. The COA defines where each transaction goes.
- **Journal Entry:** Generic accounting entry. Fields - Posting Date, Reference (could be a memo), and a table of **Journal Items** (Account, Debit amount, Credit amount, and optional dimensions like which customer or cost center). Most entries (invoices, payments) won't be made as manual journals, but all eventually create journal entries in the backend ledger.
- **Sales Invoice:** (from Selling) Fields of note for accounting - whether it's paid or not, posting date, due date, and it generates receivable line items. It has an "Is POS" or "Is Paid" flag to indicate if cash.
- **Purchase Invoice:** Fields - posting date, due date, bill date/number, etc., and generates payable entries.
- **Payment Entry:** Fields - Party Type (Customer/Supplier), Party (name), Payment Type (Receive or Pay), Mode of Payment (Cash/Bank/Mobile), Amount, and references to which invoices are being paid (with allocation amounts). Also has fields for source/destination accounts (e.g., Debiting bank and crediting receivables for a customer payment).
- **Expense Claim/Petty Cash Voucher:** If present (from HR or stand-alone), an employee expense claim might lead to accounting entries (but in a micro setting, likely the owner just records directly as expense or uses Payment Entry).
- **GL Entry:** The fundamental log of each debit/credit posted. Fields - Account, Date, Amount, Debit/Credit flag, Voucher Type (e.g., Sales Invoice), Voucher No, Party (if relevant). These entries are what the reports aggregate. TOSS generates these from other docs.
- **Company:** (Master data, holds base currency, default fiscal year, etc. - relevant for multi-tenant, each business is a Company in ERPNext terms).
- **Fiscal Year:** Defines year start/end, maybe periods. Used to filter reports, etc.
- **Cost Centers:** Possibly used to track expenses by project or department if needed (more advanced, likely one cost center if at all in small biz).
- **Accounting Dimensions:** Could be used if network had cross-company projects etc., but likely not needed for initial scope.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Accounting module UI in TOSS is designed to present essential info in a digestible way. The **Financial Dashboard** might show: _Cash on Hand: R5,000; Bank Balance: R12,000; Unpaid Customer Invoices: R8,000; Unpaid Supplier Bills: R6,000; This Month's Profit: R3,000_ - using big numbers and maybe simple charts. It's essentially giving the owner the "money in, money out, what's left" view[\[38\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L202-L208).

For someone without accounting knowledge, TOSS labels things simply. The Accounts Receivable list might be titled **"Customers Who Owe You Money"** and Accounts Payable **"Bills You Need to Pay"**[\[18\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L294-L301). Each entry shows how much and since when. The owner can click an entry to drill down (e.g., see the invoice details, and from there perhaps send a reminder or record a payment).

Recording transactions is action-oriented: **"Record an Expense"** leads to a straightforward form: amount, what it was for (choose Expense category), date, and how you paid (cash/bank). Similarly, **"Record a Sale Payment"** (for when a customer pays later) asks: which customer and invoice, how much, payment mode. The system takes care of the accounting behind.

The Chart of Accounts is mostly behind the scenes for ordinary users. But if accessed, it might be presented in plain language - e.g., under Assets: "Cash in Shop", "Bank Account - FNB", "Stock on Hand"; under Liabilities: "Supplier Bills Payable", etc. The interface encourages not messing with it unless necessary.

The **Reports** are designed to be understandable: e.g., the Profit & Loss might literally say:

- **Money In (Income):** R50,000
- **Money Out (Expenses):** R44,000
- **What's Left (Profit):** R6,000 [\[38\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L202-L208)

Then allow expanding to see categories (Income broken by Sales types, Expenses broken by salaries, rent, etc.). A Balance Sheet might say:

- Assets: Cash R5k + Stock R20k + Money owed by customers R8k = **Total Assets R33k**
- Liabilities: Loans R5k + Money owed to suppliers R4k = **Total Liabilities R9k**
- **Net Worth (Equity): R24k** (which came from initial owner's investment plus accumulated profit).

This framing helps non-accountants grasp their finances. Of course, standard terminology can be shown for those comfortable.

Another UI aspect is **automation**: many accounting entries auto-post from other modules. The owner rarely has to manually create a Journal. If they do (say, to record owner taking cash), TOSS might have a guided form: _"Owner drew R500 cash for personal use"_ and it will post debit Owner Drawings, credit Cash - without the user even seeing those account names explicitly. This reduces errors significantly.

**Offline Capabilities:** Core accounting entries are usually triggered by other activities (sales, purchases) which we've covered offline handling for. The Accounting module itself for analysis and reporting likely requires data to be synced to be meaningful. However, if the owner is offline, they can still input expenses or payments on their device - these will sit as pending transactions (much like offline invoices) and sync later. The impact on balances won't reflect for others until sync.

One should be cautious: two users offline could theoretically both pay the same invoice - but in a small biz, usually one person handles accounts. And TOSS on sync would catch that the invoice was already paid and prevent duplicate application.

So practically: if Maria pays a supplier while at a rural market with no signal, she can log that payment on her phone. When back online, it will mark the supplier bill as paid in the system for everyone (like her business partner) to see. The only thing she might not have offline is real-time bank balance if others also spent - but that's minor for short offline periods.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Let's follow Naledi from the earlier examples, who runs the hardware store. At the end of the month, she wants to see how her business did. She opens the_ _Profit & Loss_ _report in TOSS. It shows:_ _Income: R80,000,_ _Expenses: R70,000,_ _Profit: R10,000_ _for the month of March. She expands Expenses: it lists major categories - e.g.,_ _Stock Purchases: R50,000,_ _Rent: R5,000,_ _Transport: R2,000,_ _Wages: R10,000,_ _Misc: R3,000_\*. This breakdown lets her see where money is going. She's a bit concerned that transport cost is high relative to sales. The AI in TOSS might even highlight: "Transport expense is 2.5% of revenue, which is above industry norm 1%" - prompting her to investigate if trips to suppliers can be optimized.

Naledi then checks her **Balance Sheet (What You Have vs Owe)**. It shows she has **Cash R5k**, **Bank R20k**, **Inventory R30k**, **Customers Owe (Receivables) R10k**; and on Liabilities: **Suppliers Owed R8k**, **Loan from Cooperative R15k**. So, assets total R65k, liabilities R23k, net worth ~R42k (which matches her initial investment plus profits retained). This gives Naledi a sense of security - she is in net positive territory.

She uses **Accounts Receivable** view to see who owes her. There are 3 customers with unpaid invoices: one hardware contractor owes R6k not yet due (30 days terms), one individual owes R3k overdue by 5 days, etc. She decides to send gentle reminders. She selects those invoices and hits **"Send Reminder"** - TOSS generates a polite email or SMS with the invoice details. (Because her business is small, she might also just call them - TOSS could log "Reminder call made" on those accounts.)

On the payables side, she sees **Bills to Pay**: Supplier A R4k (due in 10 days), Supplier B R4k (due next month). She plans her cash - she might pay Supplier A early to maintain goodwill, so she goes to **Payments** and records a **Payment Entry**: selects Supplier A, the invoice, and chooses Bank account (since she will do an EFT). TOSS then marks that bill as paid and reduces her Bank balance accordingly in the system.

Naledi also had taken a small loan of R20k from the local cooperative a year ago (recorded as a Loan liability). Each month she's paying R1k. TOSS has an **automated journal** (or a template) for this monthly entry: it credits Bank R1k and debits the Loan liability (and a bit to interest expense). She doesn't fully grok debits/credits, but she set up a **Repeating Entry** with help from an accountant. Now every month, it auto-posts on the due date[\[52\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=What%20features%20are%20available%20in,the%20HR%20module%20of%20ERPNext). She just needs to actually send the money via bank, which she does.

Because TOSS integrates inventory, when Naledi checked her P&L, the **Cost of Goods Sold** part (stock purchases consumption) was accurate without manual calculation - every item sold had automatically expensed its cost. In the past, she might have forgotten how much stock was used and misestimated profit. Now it's precise.

During an audit from a potential microfinance investor, Naledi can confidently produce her financial statements. The investor is impressed: everything is organized and there is an audit trail. For instance, they spot a big expense entry "Wages: R10k". With Naledi's permission, TOSS drills down to show that's composed of two Salary Journal entries of R5k each for two employees - records generated from HR module. All numbers tie out.

Naledi's trust in the Accounting module means she no longer fears "the books." It's all updated through her daily operations, and she can focus on decisions - like "Can I afford another assistant?" TOSS's cash flow projection might show, yes, with current trends she maintains a positive bank balance even after adding a R3k/month wage. Thus, Accounting in TOSS not only keeps her compliant and organized, it actively guides her financial strategy.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** The AI in the Accounting module acts as a financial advisor looking out for the business's well-being. One crucial insight it provides is **cash flow forecasting**. By analyzing outgoing payables and incoming receivables (and patterns of expenses), the AI projects the cash balance weeks ahead and can warn of shortfalls. For example, _"Alert: In 2 weeks you have large payments (supplier bills and rent) totaling R20k, but based on current cash and expected sales, you may be R5k short_[_\[28\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/.cursor/rules/toss.mdc#L114-L117)_. Consider ways to increase cash (like collect receivables or reduce expenses)."_ This advance warning helps Naledi avoid a crisis like not making rent.

AI also looks at **expense anomalies**. If this month's electricity bill is way higher than usual, it flags it: _"Your utility expense is 50% higher than last month_[_\[90\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L375-L384)_."_ It might be due to a rate hike or equipment issue - either way, it draws her attention to investigate. Similarly, it watches for creeping costs (e.g., stationery or data costs slowly rising each month).

Another feature is **margin analysis**. AI will continuously calculate product or service margins from integrated data (sales price vs cost) and identify any problematic trends: _"The margin on Product X has fallen to 5%. Check if purchase costs increased or price needs updating."_ If integrated with sales and stock, it can pinpoint where money might be leaking.

For businesses with debt or loans, AI monitors **financial ratios** somewhat. It might note: _"Your inventory turnover is low (stock sitting ~90 days on average). That's cash tied up - consider a sale to liquidate old stock,"_ linking inventory management with finances. Or, _"Your accounts receivable days are high (averaging 60 days). Maybe tighten credit terms to improve cash flow."_ These are things an experienced accountant would advise; AI brings that advice to someone like Naledi automatically in simple language.

AI can also optimize **bill payments**. For instance, if she has some early payment discounts available, it could suggest: _"If you pay Supplier B 10 days early, you save R200 in discounts. Currently, you have enough cash, so it's beneficial."_ Conversely, if cash is tight, it might suggest prioritizing which bills to pay first (taking into account due dates and any supplier relations).

With respect to **tax compliance**, AI can ensure she's setting aside enough for VAT or income tax. It could say: _"Based on this quarter's sales, expected VAT liability is ~R8k_[_\[39\]_](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/v13/user/manual/en/accounts#:~:text=In%20ERPNext%2C%20accounting%20operations%20consists,of%203%20main%20transactions)_. Make sure you have that reserved."_ Similarly for any other statutory dues.

When the network aspect is considered, if Naledi's data (anonymized) is part of a benchmark, AI might tell her: _"Your profit margin is 12%, while the average among similar shops in the network is 15%. Check if your costs (like cost of goods or rent) are higher, or if your pricing can be improved."_ This gives her context of performance beyond her own books.

**Collaborative Network Features:** On a network level, Accounting could enable things like **group financial services**. For example, a network of businesses might collectively approach a lender or grant program. With members' consent, they could produce combined financial statements or at least key figures (total turnover of network, combined profit, etc.) to strengthen their case. TOSS could aggregate these safely - e.g., a report showing "Network X total quarterly revenue: R500k, average profit margin: 10%" which can impress a microfinance institution to extend credit lines to the group.

Another collaborative feature is handling **inter-company transactions** within the network. If businesses trade amongst themselves (one's output is another's input), TOSS can streamline those entries by linking their accounting. For example, Shop A buys bulk rice and sells part of it to Shop B. In Shop A's books it's a sale, in Shop B's books a purchase. If both use TOSS and agree to link, a single entry could post to both: credit Shop A's sales and debit Shop B's purchases simultaneously (via the network layer). This ensures books reconcile and saves time. Of course, it would only happen with trust and arrangements in the network.

The network could also have shared **accounting services**. Perhaps they hire a bookkeeper to oversee all members' books monthly. That bookkeeper (with permission) could have access to each tenant's Accounting module via a unified interface, rather than logging into each separately. TOSS could provide an accountant portal to manage multiple companies (this is more of a multi-company feature). The benefit is cost-sharing on expert help, and uniform quality of bookkeeping. The accountant could also generate a combined report for the network leadership showing aggregate financial health without revealing individual secrets (similar to above point).

Additionally, network-wide **financial training or policies** can be rolled out. For instance, they might set a norm that all members maintain at least 10% of monthly sales as cash reserve. TOSS can monitor and notify the network committee if someone is struggling to do so (could be a sign they need assistance). Or if the network has a group insurance or emergency fund, TOSS Accounting can facilitate contributions to it - automatically deducting a tiny percentage of each sale across members into a "Network Fund" account (in each member's books as an expense, and in a central network account as income).

Another scenario: a network might collectively guarantee a member's loan. If that member defaults, the network covers it. TOSS could track such cross-liability. If Member A misses a payment, it could flag to network treasurer, and if it's paid from a central fund, the system could record due from Member A to network. This is complex but demonstrates how integrated accounting can support mutual aid frameworks.

Lastly, transparency can be increased within safe limits. Some networks might choose to share certain financial metrics internally to encourage mutual improvement or trust. For example, they could agree to share revenue figures or expense ratios. TOSS could have a dashboard for members that shows anonymized quartiles or average with theirs. E.g., "Your monthly sales are in the top 25% of the network" or "Your rent-to-sales ratio is higher than 80% of members." This might drive collaborative initiatives like bulk rent negotiation or sharing of high-performing tactics.

In summary, while each business keeps its own books in TOSS, the network layer can pool financial knowledge and strength - enabling collective bargaining, support, and perhaps even shared fiscal responsibility. Accounting data, when aggregated and permissioned correctly, becomes a powerful tool for communal advancement and resilience in the township economy.

## Manufacturing (Production Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The Manufacturing module helps businesses plan and manage the process of converting raw materials into finished products. It covers everything from defining the **Bill of Materials (BOM)** for a product to scheduling production, issuing materials, and tracking work-in-progress and outputs[\[41\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=The%20Manufacturing%20module%20in%20ERPNext,conduct%20various%20manufacturing%20operations%20effectively)[\[45\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,and%20optimizing%20production%20runs%20to). For small manufacturers like bakeries, furniture makers, or artisans, this module ensures that they can efficiently produce goods, control production costs, and meet customer demand on time. It tightly integrates with Stock (for raw material consumption and finished goods stocking), Buying (for procuring materials), and Accounting (for costing and work-in-progress value).

**Core Workflows:**

- **Bill of Materials (BOM) Definition:** Create a BOM for each manufactured product, listing all the raw materials (and their quantities) and any sub-assemblies required to make one unit of finished product[\[45\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,and%20optimizing%20production%20runs%20to). For example, a wooden table's BOM might include: 5 planks of wood, 20 screws, 100ml varnish. A BOM can also include labor or machine time for cost purposes (e.g., 2 hours carpentry labor).
- **Work Order (Production Order):** When it's time to produce, create a Work Order specifying what product to make, how many, and which BOM to use[\[45\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,and%20optimizing%20production%20runs%20to). For instance, "Produce 10 Tables using Standard Table BOM." The Work Order serves as the central document to track that production batch. It can include target start and end dates.
- **Material Issue (for Production):** Before or during production, **Issue Raw Materials** to manufacturing. TOSS can automatically pull the exact quantities from BOM for the given production quantity. The storekeeper or production lead then confirms issuing those from stock (this creates a Stock Entry of type "Material Transfer" from raw material store to Work in Progress or consumes them directly). This ensures raw material inventory is decreased accordingly.
- **Production Execution:** If detailed tracking is needed, the module can break the Work Order into **Operations** (steps) performed at **Workstations** (e.g., Cutting, Assembly, Finishing)[\[45\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,and%20optimizing%20production%20runs%20to). Operators can mark each operation complete, possibly using **Job Cards** for time tracking at each step. For simple cases, these steps can be skipped, and one can just mark the Work Order as started and then finished when done.
- **Quality Checks & Approvals:** (Integration with Quality module) During or after production, perform quality inspections (e.g., check dimensions, strength, or taste for food) as defined for the product. The Work Order might require a quality check sign-off before completion[\[43\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,insights%20into%20production%20performance%2C%20costs).
- **Finish Goods Receipt:** Once production is completed (all operations done and quality passed), **Receive Finished Goods** into stock. In TOSS, this can be done by submitting a **Work Order Completion** which automatically creates a Stock Entry of type "Manufacture/Repack" - moving the raw materials out of WIP (or consuming them) and adding the finished product into Finished Goods stock. For example, after producing 10 tables, stock of "Table" item increases by 10, and the wood, screws, etc. are reduced accordingly.
- **Costing:** The module calculates the total production cost for the Work Order. It sums material costs (based on stock valuations issued) and can include operation costs (either from labor time logs or predetermined rates). This yields a cost per unit produced. TOSS updates the valuation of the finished goods accordingly in inventory (so the 10 tables carry the correct manufacturing cost). If there is a variance (like usage of more material than BOM or scrap), it's recorded as a **Manufacturing Variance** for analysis.
- **Production Planning (optional):** For more complex operations, one can use a **Production Plan** to consolidate demand (sales orders or stock refill levels) and generate multiple Work Orders and material procurement requirements at once. This might be more than a micro unit needs, but it's there if scaling up.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **BOM Accuracy:** A BOM must be **Approved** before use (to avoid using a draft by mistake). TOSS ensures BOMs don't have circular references (A BOM referring to itself via sub-assembly) and that quantities are sensible (no zero quantities). Only one BOM is usually marked default per item.
- **Work Order Quantity vs. BOM:** If you make a different quantity than BOM standard, TOSS scales the material requirements. E.g., BOM for 1 cake needs 2kg flour; a Work Order for 5 cakes will demand 10kg flour. It validates material availability: if you don't have enough on hand, it will warn or prevent starting the Work Order unless you allow it (which could result in negative stock for materials).
- **Material Consumption Enforcement:** The system expects you to issue the materials either up-front or during production. By completion, all required materials should be issued (or you explicitly mark some as not used or extra used). If a Work Order completion is attempted without issuing enough raw materials, TOSS warns you (or auto-issues from stock if configured to backflush).
- **Operation Completion:** If using operations and job cards, the system can enforce sequence (can't mark Assembly done before Cutting is done, etc.). It can also ensure that all operations are completed (or explicitly skipped) before allowing final completion of the Work Order.
- **Quality Hold:** Optionally, if quality tests fail, the Work Order cannot be completed (or the product goes into a "Rejected" stock location). This ensures faulty goods aren't counted as good stock.
- **Scrap Accounting:** If some raw material ends up as scrap (offcuts, wastage) or some finished products are defective, TOSS can capture those. Scrap can be defined on BOM (expected % waste) or entered at finish. The rule is that total material output (finished + scrap) should tally with input or else show as unexplained loss. This reflects in costing as well.
- **Auto-Accounting:** Upon completion, the module posts necessary accounting: credit raw material inventory, debit WIP (if tracked) or expenses, and debit finished goods inventory, credit WIP. If using a WIP account, Work Orders serve to collect costs. Simpler approach: TOSS might directly expense variances to a "Manufacturing variance" account and move materials to finished goods at standard cost. Either way, it ensures books reflect the production.
- **Concurrency and Capacity:** If desired, the system can check **Workstation capacity** (e.g., machine can only handle 5 units a day). But for simplicity, this might be turned off unless needed. Without capacity planning, overlapping work orders are allowed unless manually monitored.
- **Production Order Closure:** A Work Order can be closed if it's not going to be fully completed. For instance, you planned 100 units but decided to stop at 95 due to scrap. Closing it finalizes it with less output; TOSS might treat the 5 short as cancelled or as scrap. It should prompt what to do with remaining materials (return to stock or mark as waste).

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:**

- **BOM:** Fields - Item (finished good), Quantity (of finished good that this BOM yields, typically 1), BOM Items (table of raw materials: each row with Item Code, Required Qty per FG qty, maybe Scrap %), Operations (table if any: Operation name, time per unit or batch, Workstation, labor cost). Also a field for BOM cost (system calculated from items and operation rates).
- **Work Order:** Fields - Product to manufacture, Quantity to manufacture, BOM to use, Status (Not Started, In Process, Completed, Closed), Planned Start/End dates, Actual Start/End, and links to stock entries (material issues and completions) and any job cards. Also can have a Source like which Sales Order it's for.
- **Operation:** (Master for types of work) Fields - Operation name, description, Workstation Type or default workstation, and maybe standard time or cost.
- **Workstation:** Fields - Name, possibly capacity (units per hour or hours per day available), cost per hour (for cost calculations), and maintenance schedule if relevant.
- **Job Card:** If used - Fields: Work Order, Operation, Employee/Person who did it, Start Time, End Time, Quantity produced in that step (if incremental), status (Pending/Completed). This logs actual operation time and progress.
- **Stock Entry (for Manufacture):** A specific kind of stock entry with two sets of child tables - one for consumed items (materials) and one for produced items (finished goods and by-products, if any). This is usually auto-generated by Work Order completion in TOSS rather than manual.
- **Batch & Serial:** If finished goods or raw materials are batch/serial tracked, BOM can note if it inherits serial (like assembly keeps component serial numbers). Work Order completion will then require entering serial numbers for output (if serialized) and listing which serials of inputs were used.
- **Production Plan:** Fields - list of Sales Orders or items needed, and it will generate suggested Work Orders and Material Requests. (This is advanced usage; likely optional for most small cases.)

**User Interface & Experience:** The Manufacturing interface is streamlined for ease of use on a small scale. The **Work Order list** gives a quick view of each production job's status, e.g., "Table (10 units) - In Process - 80%". Clicking one opens a **Progress View**: at the top, basic info like item and quantity, below that maybe a visual timeline of operations or a checklist (if not using operations, it could simply show material status and a big "Complete Order" button when ready).

For those not familiar with manufacturing jargon, TOSS might label Work Orders as **"Production Job"** or **"Batch"**. On mobile, creating a new production job could be as simple as selecting the finished item and quantity - if only one BOM exists, it's auto-selected. Then you see a screen: "Materials Needed: 5x Wood Plank (50 in stock), 20x Screws (200 in stock), ... \[Issue All Materials\]". The **Issue All Materials** button creates the stock issue entry automatically. If stock is short, it would highlight in red or prompt to order missing parts (with a one-click to create a Purchase Order for shortages).

If operations are not heavily used, TOSS likely won't force the user through them - maybe just an optional tab "Operations" to mark if they want to track. For many, they'll skip straight to completion once materials are issued and time has passed. The **Complete Production** action would show: "You planned 10 units. Enter how many finished actually made: \[10\]. Any scrap or unused materials? \[maybe list items and allow adjust\]." After confirmation, it posts the stock entry and closes the Work Order.

For those tracking detail: each Operation in a Work Order can be shown as a card with "Start" and "Finish" buttons (or a field to enter time taken). If a worker uses the system, they might just see their assigned operation on an app and hit start when begin and finish when done; the Work Order updates accordingly.

The BOM editor UI is important: it should allow quick adding of items, maybe by searching the item name, entering quantity, and perhaps scrap %. Possibly upload from an existing template (copy another BOM). Since BOMs might be created rarely, it's okay if that's a bit more advanced.

TOSS can also have a **Production Analytics** view: e.g., how many of each product made this month, production efficiency (if times are tracked vs standard), and a cost summary. This is useful to see trends (like cost of wood rising reflected in higher table cost now than before).

**Offline Capabilities:** Production often happens in a workshop that might not have internet. So TOSS offline is handy for shop floor logging. Workers could receive a synced Work Order in the morning, then go offline. They can check off operations or log issues offline. If quality inspectors are walking around with a tablet, they can input results offline into the Work Order's quality section.

Issuing materials might require connection if one needs real-time stock check, but if pre-planned, one could also issue offline (it will sync and decrement stock when connected; risk of conflict is if someone else also moved that stock concurrently - but in a small setup usually one person handles it).

Completing a Work Order offline will generate the stock entry queued locally. Until sync, central inventory won't show the finished goods. But once connected, everything updates: raw stocks decrement, finished goods increment. If any conflict (like those materials were somehow consumed by something else in the interim), the sync will flag discrepancy to reconcile (rare scenario in practice with small teams).

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Akhona runs a small bakery, making bread and pastries each morning. She uses TOSS Manufacturing to plan her daily baking. She has a BOM for "Bread Loaf" that lists: 500g flour, 300ml water, 10g yeast, a pinch of salt and sugar (negligible cost). For "Dozen Scones," a BOM with flour, butter, sugar, etc., is defined too.

Each evening, Akhona checks tomorrow's orders (from Sales) and shop stock. She decides to make 50 loaves and 20 dozens of scones tomorrow. In TOSS, she creates two **Work Orders**: one for 50 Bread Loaves, one for 20 Dozen Scones. The app immediately shows how much of each ingredient is needed. She sees she has enough of everything except yeast - yeast is a bit short for the bread. She clicks **"Shortfall -> Create Purchase Request"**. This raises a quick Material Request for yeast which she sends to her ingredient supplier via WhatsApp that night. The supplier delivers early morning and she records the Purchase Receipt, adding the yeast into stock.

In the morning, before mixing, she goes to the Bread Work Order on her tablet and hits **"Issue Materials"**. It subtracts the required flour, yeast, etc. from stock (she's weighed them out ready to mix). Similarly for scones. Now as she bakes, if she had help, she might use operations like "Mixing, Baking, Packaging" with times, but since it's just her and one assistant, she skips detailed logging. By 9am, all bread and scones are done.

She opens the Work Order in TOSS, taps **"Complete Production"**. For bread, it asks "Actual produced vs planned?". Overnight some bread burned, so she got 48 good loaves out of planned 50. She enters 48. It then asks what happened to the other 2 - she marks them as **Scrap** due to burn (so it will still account for the used ingredients). Upon submission, TOSS moves 48 Bread into Finished Goods stock (now available for sale)[\[43\]](https://docs.frappe.io/erpnext/user/manual/en/manufacturing#:~:text=,insights%20into%20production%20performance%2C%20costs), and the ingredients corresponding to 50 loaves are fully consumed (the cost of those 2 burnt loaves stays in a "Scrap Expense" account).

For scones, all 20 dozens came out fine, so she completes with 20 and no scrap. Those are added to stock, ingredients consumed.

Now throughout the day, her front-of-house sells the bread and scones via POS. Inventory goes down accordingly. At day's end, Akhona looks at the Production Analytics: it shows bread yield was 96% (48/50) and scones 100%. It also shows cost per loaf computed - she notices it's slightly higher today because yeast price went up. She decides it might be time to adjust her bread price up a little to maintain margin.

The Manufacturing module helped Akhona ensure she had the ingredients ready (flagging the yeast shortage) and accounted for everything that happened (even burnt bread). Over time, if she sees frequent scrap, she can adjust her BOMs or processes (or add a bit of scrap allowance in BOM so it doesn't always show as variance). It gives her a clear view of her production efficiency and cost, which is crucial for pricing and minimizing waste.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** AI in Manufacturing acts like a process engineer and production planner for Akhona. One of its roles is **demand forecasting for production**: based on historical sales and maybe external factors (weather, day of week), it can suggest how much to produce. For instance, _"Typically on Tuesdays you sell ~40 loaves. Tomorrow is a public holiday, demand might be higher - recommend baking 60 loaves."_ It could also look at current stock and say _"You still have 5 loaves unsold from today (stale risk), so maybe reduce tomorrow's production by that much."_ This helps optimize production quantity to meet demand without excessive leftovers.

AI can also optimize **BOM and processes** by analyzing usage vs output. If consistently, say, bread yields are 96%, AI might learn that 4% scrap is normal and adjust expectations (or suggest tweaks: _"You often burn ~4% of loaves - consider lowering oven temp or bake time slightly as an experiment."_). If an ingredient's actual usage often differs from BOM (maybe recipes are adjusted on the fly), AI will flag that and suggest updating the BOM to reality or investigate why more/less is used.

In terms of operations, if Akhona had multiple staff or machines, AI could do **production scheduling**: deciding which products to make first or how to sequence to maximize efficiency (e.g., _"Bake breads before pastries because oven is already hot from bread, saving energy."_ or _"Mix all doughs in one go if capacity allows, then bake - to reduce idle time."_). In larger settings, it might allocate work to different workstations to balance load.

For **maintenance** (though part of Quality or Assets), AI might watch production metrics to predict if equipment could be failing - e.g., _"Oven took longer to bake this week (noted by extended operation times), possible element issue - check before it breaks."_

AI also contributes to **cost control**: it monitors the cost of each batch and identifies trends. _"The cost per loaf has increased 10% due to ingredient price rises_[_\[30\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L274-L282)_. Suggest either raising price or finding cheaper supplier for flour."_ Or _"Labor time per batch is increasing, perhaps due to inexperienced staff - consider refresher training to improve speed."_

For multi-product environments, AI can advise on **product mix**: e.g., _"Bread has a higher profit margin and demand than scones - allocate more flour to bread production if resources are constrained."_

**Collaborative Network Features:** In a network context, Manufacturing collaboration might involve **shared production facilities** or **outsourced work among members**. For example, if one bakery in the network has excess oven capacity and another's oven broke, the first could temporarily bake for the second. Through TOSS, a Work Order could be assigned to a different business's facility. In practice, one company could issue a **Subcontract Work Order** to another: TOSS would create the necessary accounting (selling of service, etc.)[\[48\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L430-L438). The network could coordinate such resource sharing, with TOSS tracking who provided materials and labor and how the final product is transferred.

The network could also standardize BOMs for similar products across members, sharing best recipes and methods. For instance, a co-op of soap makers might unify a base formula. TOSS can distribute a BOM template through the network so each member's Manufacturing module uses the proven recipe (they can adjust for local tweaks, but a baseline is shared).

Additionally, networks can aggregate **raw material procurement for production**. Through Buying collab, members already bulk-buy. The Manufacturing modules of each could be fed by a central material warehouse. It's similar to stock pooling: raw materials could be stored centrally and issued to members' Work Orders on demand, with TOSS handling the inter-company stock issues. This ensures each small producer always has materials when needed without individually storing large stocks.

On a more strategic level, the network might decide to specialize production among members: e.g., Bakery A focuses on bread, B on pastries, then they swap products to sell a full range. Their Manufacturing schedules could be coordinated via network planning. TOSS could support by letting one member's Sales Orders generate another member's Work Orders automatically. Say Bakery B gets a big cake order but is at capacity; the network portal shows this to other bakers who can take the job. If Bakery C accepts, a Work Order appears in C's system to make the cake, and upon completion, the cake is transferred to B for delivery. All the monetary settlement can be handled through linked accounting entries (B paying C for subcontracting). The **Subcontracting** feature in ERPNext is analogous to this scenario[\[48\]](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L430-L438).

Quality and training are also collaborative: network can implement a unified **Quality Management System** for all producers. TOSS Quality data from each (like failure rates, inspections) can be reviewed collectively to improve processes. If one member has a particularly efficient process (yield, time), others can learn from them through the network's knowledge sharing.

Finally, for marketing, the network might label products collectively (like a brand for a co-op). Ensuring consistency via Manufacturing module is key. The network might periodically audit each member's production (with TOSS checklists) to maintain quality standards for the common brand. Those audits (like Good Manufacturing Practice checks) can be scheduled and recorded in each Manufacturing/Quality module but overseen by the network committee.

In summary, the Manufacturing module within a network enables a distributed manufacturing system where capacity, knowledge, and resources are shared. Small local manufacturers can work together almost like departments of a larger factory - coordinating production, helping each other, and collectively meeting larger demands than any could alone, all facilitated by the integrated information flows in TOSS.

## Projects (Project Management Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The Projects module assists in planning and tracking project-based work - any endeavor with multiple tasks, a timeline, and deliverables. This could be external (e.g., a client project or a community construction job) or internal (setting up a new shop, a marketing campaign). It provides tools to break work into **tasks**, assign responsibilities, track deadlines, and monitor progress and costs. For small businesses, formal project management might seem heavy, but many can benefit from it - like a plumber scheduling a set of repairs, or a tailoring shop managing a large order with various steps. The Projects module ensures such activities are executed efficiently and that nothing falls through the cracks.

**Core Workflows:**

- **Project Creation:** Define a **Project** when there's a significant piece of work involving multiple steps or people. Give it a name, description, start and end date, and possibly associate it with a customer (if it's for a client) or with an internal goal. For example, "Community Center Paint Job - Client: ABC Org - Start May 1, End May 7."
- **Task Breakdown:** Under the project, list out **Tasks** that need to be completed[\[49\]](https://discuss.frappe.io/c/erpnext/projects/53#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20ERPNext%20Proejcts,discuss%2C%20and%20help%20other%20communi%E2%80%A6). Each task is a specific piece of work with its own due date and assignee. For the painting job, tasks might be "Buy paint and materials", "Prep walls (cleaning and sanding)", "Apply primer coat", "Paint walls color coat", "Clean up site".
- **Assignment & Scheduling:** Assign each task to a person (or team). Set deadlines for each task (the system can also auto-stagger if you input task durations and dependencies). If certain tasks must happen in sequence, set dependencies (e.g., "Paint color coat" depends on finishing "Primer coat"). The module can then show a simple Gantt chart or timeline of the tasks.
- **Execution & Updates:** Team members can view their tasks (say via a to-do list or calendar). As they work, they can update tasks - mark them as In Progress or Completed, add notes or attach photos (e.g., a photo of the completed paint job). The project manager (or business owner) can monitor progress through a Project dashboard that might show percent complete or highlight any task overdue.
- **Time & Cost Tracking:** If needed, record **Time Logs** or **Expense Logs** against tasks. For instance, an electrician logs 3 hours on the "Wiring" task of a project, or a volunteer logs hours on a community project (which might not bill to a client but is tracked for accountability). Expenses like bought materials can also link to the project so you know total project cost.
- **Milestones & Billing:** Projects can have **Milestones** (key events/deliverables). In client projects, milestones often tie to payments. TOSS allows linking a Sales Invoice to a project or milestone. E.g., invoice 50% upon milestone "Primer done" and 50% on "Project completion." The module then shows what's been billed vs. what's left. For internal projects, this can be skipped.
- **Project Completion & Review:** Once all tasks are done (or the goal is reached), mark the project Completed/Closed. You can then review actual finish date vs planned, actual cost vs budget (if you set a budget), etc., to learn for next time.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Task Dependencies:** If Task B depends on A, the system should not allow marking B complete until A is done, or at least warn if trying to start B early. Also, moving A's date should auto-adjust B's if possible (or flag a schedule slip).
- **Deadlines & Overdue:** The system automatically flags tasks that pass their due date without completion. These should be visible in red in the project view and in the assignee's task list. Optionally, send a reminder email/notification on the due date if not completed.
- **Resource Assignments:** Each task usually has one assignee. If multiple people, you might break it into sub-tasks or simply list multiple names in description. TOSS doesn't enforce workloads or hours by default, but if a user has too many tasks due same day, it's visible for the manager to reassign if needed. (There is capability for scheduling by capacity, but that may be overkill for now.)
- **Project Budget & Cost:** If you set a project budget (in terms of money or total hours), the system should track actuals and warn when nearing or exceeding budget. For example, if a project budget is R5k expenses and you log purchase receipts of R4.5k already, it might warn 90% budget used.
- **Linkage to Billing:** If using project-based billing, TOSS can ensure you don't miss invoicing for billable work. For instance, time logs can be marked billable, and you can generate an invoice from them. The rule might be that all billable hours should be invoiced when project completes or monthly, etc. The system can list unbilled costs for manager to invoice.
- **Access Control:** Possibly restrict who can see what projects. If you have external collaborators using the system (less likely, but suppose a client or subcontractor logs in to update tasks), you'd ensure they only see their project. But likely, one company uses it internally only.
- **Closure Conditions:** You shouldn't close a project if there are tasks not done (unless you explicitly cancel them). TOSS likely prompts to complete or delete remaining tasks. Also, if some budget left or invoices not done, it might remind the user.

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:**

- **Project:** Fields - Project Name, Customer (if applicable), Start Date, End Date (planned vs actual), Status (Open/Completed/Cancelled), Percent Complete (calculated from tasks done), Project Manager (could be the user responsible). Perhaps budget fields (planned cost, planned revenue).
- **Task:** Fields - Subject/Title, Description, Project (link), Assigned To (user), Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, etc.), Start Date, Due Date, Actual Completion Date, Priority (Low/Med/High), Depends On (link to another task). Could also have a field for estimated hours and actual hours logged.
- **Time Log:** If using - Fields: Project, Task (optional link), User, Date, Hours, Work Details description, Billable (yes/no), Billing Rate (if applicable).
- **Expense Log (or use Expense Claim/Purchase Invoice):** Simpler might be just tag any Purchase Invoice or expense Payment with a Project, so project cost is accumulated. If separate: Fields - Project, description, amount, date, maybe category of expense.
- **Milestone:** Could be a child table in Project with fields: Milestone name, target date, status (achieved/pending). If integrated with billing: milestone could have a billing percentage or amount.
- **Project Template:** For repeating types of projects, a template of tasks. Fields - name, and a set of tasks with relative dates (e.g., Day 1: X, Day 3: Y, etc.). Not critical but useful for standard projects like "New shop setup."
- **Issue:** (From support maybe, but if an issue/bug is linked to a project, might be tracked as well. Probably not in MVP need.)

**User Interface & Experience:** Managing a project in TOSS would typically involve a **Project Dashboard** view. When you open a project, you see the project's vital info at top (name, client, due date) and maybe a progress bar (e.g., "5 of 10 tasks completed - 50%"). Below that, tasks are often listed either in a hierarchical list or a board. In ERPNext, tasks can be indented or shown in Gantt. For mobile, likely a simple list sorted by due date with perhaps overdue tasks highlighted red, upcoming in green, etc.

Each **Task** entry shows a title, assignee, and maybe a checkbox for completion. Tapping it opens details where you can update status or reassign or change dates. Possibly an assignee can just swipe to mark complete or something.

There might be a toggle to view tasks grouped by status, or a **Kanban** board with columns To-Do, Doing, Done, which is intuitive and mobile-friendly (you could drag tasks between columns or use a menu to change status).

The **Gantt chart** view is useful on a larger screen - showing tasks on a timeline, dependencies lines. On mobile maybe not needed, but on the web interface that could be present. This helps visualize if the project is on schedule.

For team members, a **My Tasks** view aggregates tasks from all projects assigned to that user, sorted by due date. This is essentially their to-do list. They might just interact with that most of the time.

Logging time or expenses can be integrated: e.g., on a task, a user might click "Log Hours" and enter "2 hours - finished painting one wall" which then attaches to the task (and project) and updates progress possibly. Or they mark task done and then it might ask "how many hours did it take?" as a prompt if needed.

If using deadlines heavily, the system could send notifications: e.g., day before a task due, to the assignee. Or if a project is due next week and only 50% tasks done, a warning to the manager.

**Offline Capabilities:** Team members working on-site (like the painting crew at the community center) may have no net. TOSS offline allows them to open the project tasks list that was synced prior. They can check tasks off or add comments offline (like "need more paint, will resume tomorrow"). When back online, those updates sync, so the project manager sees them. If multiple people update offline, there's slight risk of conflicting edits (e.g., two people marking the same task complete - which is benign). TOSS can handle basic conflict by last update wins for status, or merging comments.

Creating new tasks offline also possible; they sync and appear for others. Say the team realized an extra task "fix crack in wall" - they add it offline, and once synced, the manager sees this new task added to scope.

The main limitation offline is no real-time collaboration - but team can work independently and sync later. For a short project, that's fine. Over a longer term, daily sync is enough.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** _Jabulani has a small construction business. He got a contract to build a 2-room extension for a client. He sets this up as a_ _Project_ _in TOSS: "Ndaba House 2-Room Extension" with start today and deadline in 30 days, client Mr. Ndaba. He lists out_ _Tasks_\*: (1) Draw plan and get client approval, (2) Foundation and floor, (3) Walls up, (4) Roof installation, (5) Electrical wiring, (6) Plaster and finishing, (7) Painting, (8) Final cleanup and handover. He assigns himself to oversee, his bricklayer to tasks 2 and 3, a roofer sub-contractor to task 4 (notes that he's external), an electrician (task 5), and painter (task 7).

He sequences them with dependencies (foundation before walls, walls before roof, etc.). TOSS automatically spaces the Gantt chart roughly over the 30 days timeline, which he adjusts as needed (maybe he sets Walls to take 5 days after foundation done, etc.). The app highlights if any gap or overlap - he ensures there's not too much idle time but also that tasks that can parallel (e.g., electrical can do conduit while plastering maybe) are marked accordingly.

Throughout execution, Jabulani uses the **Project view** to monitor progress. When foundation is finished, he marks Task 2 complete (or his bricklayer does via the mobile app in the field). TOSS moves Task 3 (Walls) to "In Progress" automatically since dependency cleared. He also logs an **Expense** for cement and bricks used, linking it to the project (he simply does that by tagging the purchase invoice from the supplier with project name in TOSS). This way, under project costs he sees R15,000 spent on materials so far.

One week it rains heavily, causing delays. Jabulani goes into the project and shifts the Roof task 2 days later. TOSS warns this might push past deadline. Indeed, now Gantt shows finishing in 32 days. He informs the client and also tries to make up time later.

His electrician completes wiring and marks that task done via his phone. Immediately, Jabulani gets an app notification "Task 5 (Electrical wiring) completed by Samkelo." That triggers Jabulani to schedule an inspection of that work before plastering covers it. He adds a quick sub-task "Inspect wiring before plaster" and assigns himself, due next day. Offline or not, he notes after checking that all is good and marks that done.

At the end, the project finishes in 33 days (3 days late, mostly due to weather). Jabulani closes the project in TOSS. He reviews the **Project Report**: it shows 33 days actual vs 30 planned, and total cost R50k vs budget R45k (he sees that extra work like fixing a rain-damaged section and the delay cost some extra labor - he'll budget more contingency next time). He also sees total billed is R60k (he had invoiced the client in 3 stages from TOSS directly linked to project milestones). So profit was ~R10k on that project.

With this insight, Jabulani can refine quotes for future projects (maybe increase margin to cover unexpected delays). The Projects module helped him stay organized - he always knew what was done and what was left, even coordinating multiple trades (bricklayer, electrician, etc.). If the network or community asks for a report, he can produce a neat summary to show the work timeline and costs, lending professionalism to his small operation.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** For projects, AI becomes a **smart project assistant** that can predict pitfalls and optimize scheduling. For example, it can analyze Jabulani's past projects and say: _"Foundation tasks on average took 2 days longer than you planned, consider that in new schedules."_ Or _"Projects of this type (2-room extension) historically see 5% overspend on materials - perhaps add buffer in quote."_

During the project, AI can watch task progress and due dates to flag risks: _"Roof installation task is due in 2 days but its predecessor (Walls) is only 50% done - project likely to slip_[_\[51\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L360-L364)_."_ This early warning allows reallocation of resources or client notice. It could even suggest actions: _"Consider adding a second bricklayer to speed up Walls and meet the roof schedule."_

AI can also assist in **task prioritization**: if a user has many tasks across projects, it might generate a daily priority list: _"High priority today: complete Painting for Project X (deadline tomorrow), start Foundation for Project Y (to avoid rain forecast next week)."_ It's like having a project manager nudging the user.

For complex dependencies, the AI can run simulations (like PERT). For instance, _"There is a 80% chance project will finish by June 30; a 20% risk of running till July 5 due to known rainy season delays."_ This helps manage client expectations and push to mitigate (maybe building rain covers or adjusting order of tasks).

If multiple projects run in parallel, AI can alert if they will overload a particular resource. E.g., _"Your electrician is scheduled for full days on two projects next Thursday_[_\[50\]_](https://discuss.frappe.io/t/about-the-project-management-category/56267#:~:text=About%20the%20Project%20Management%20category,category%2C%20you%20can%20post)_. You need to reschedule tasks or get an additional electrician to avoid delay."_

Also, AI can track **learning from feedback**: if client feedback is recorded (maybe via support or closing notes), it can correlate. _"Projects where 'prep work' task was rushed had lower client satisfaction. Ensure adequate time for prep in future."_ Or simply note patterns like one team member consistently finishing tasks faster - maybe let them mentor others or take lead on critical tasks.

From a collaborative view, if multiple network members execute similar projects, AI could benchmark: _"Your average house painting project takes 10 days; network average is 8 days. Perhaps learn techniques or tools that peers use to be more efficient."_

**Collaborative Network Features:** Project collaboration in a network might involve joint projects or sharing skilled labor. For instance, a larger construction job in the community might be too big for one small contractor, so multiple network members form a temporary joint venture. TOSS can allow a **Project** to have tasks assigned to different companies in the network. Each company sees tasks relevant to them and can manage their parts (with limited access to others if needed). The central project coordinator (perhaps the network admin or lead contractor) sees the whole picture and each member's progress. This way, a project is truly collaborative - e.g., one business handles foundation, another handles structure, another does finishing. TOSS can integrate with accounting too: each member could bill the lead for their portion, and the lead bills the client - all tracked under one project.

Networks can also maintain a **pool of experts or volunteers** that can be assigned to projects. For example, if one member needs an extra electrician for a project, they could create a task and assign it to "Network Electrician Pool" - which notifies available electricians in the network (maybe who marked themselves free). The first to accept gets assigned and becomes responsible. TOSS could facilitate this by showing open tasks to users in a network job board.

For community projects (like building a community center via a business network's social initiative), multiple businesses might contribute resources (material, labor). They can all log their contributions under the project in TOSS. The project report then shows total contributions, who provided what, etc. - useful for transparency and impact reporting.

The Project Templates can be shared network-wide for common projects (like a standard "Install solar panel system" project template if many members do similar projects, providing a best-practice task list for consistency).

Also, on a knowledge level, project post-mortems can be shared. One business might note "Project X: We experienced delay due to late material delivery from Supplier Y." If allowed, that note could be visible to others or fed into AI insights for them (like cautioning when planning similar project to factor that supplier's lead time or choose alternate supplier from network experiences).

Finally, the network can showcase completed projects collectively - for marketing, a network portfolio. TOSS could feed data (with permission) to a network website page listing projects done by members (pictures, scope, feedback). This shows the network's collective capability to take on large or numerous projects.

In essence, the Projects module, when extended beyond a single business, becomes a tool for **coordinated effort and mutual aid**. It allows a group of small entities to act in concert on bigger initiatives, share workload, and learn from each project, thereby taking on projects that individually they couldn't, and improving success rates across the board.

## HR (Human Resources & Payroll Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The HR module manages **employee information and basic HR processes** such as attendance, leave (time off), payroll, and perhaps recruitment. For small businesses, this module keeps track of the people working in the business - even if it's just a few employees or part-timers - and automates things like salary calculations or leave balance tracking. It ensures employees are paid correctly and on time, and that their leave or off days are accounted for. Essentially, it gives small employers some of the organizational benefits bigger companies have, in a simplified form[\[52\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=What%20features%20are%20available%20in,the%20HR%20module%20of%20ERPNext).

**Core Workflows:**

- **Employee Records:** Create an **Employee** profile for each staff member (or contractor) once they join. This contains personal details (contact info, ID), job information (designation/role, date of joining, maybe salary details), and perhaps bank account for salary transfer. For example, if Thabo hires an assistant, he enters them as an Employee with start date and wage.
- **Attendance Tracking:** If needed, record **Attendance** daily or monthly. In a tiny shop, the owner might not formally track attendance; but if they want, they can mark each employee Present/Absent for each day. This can be done manually or even via an attendance code scan or mobile punch-in. It's optional, but it feeds into payroll if used (e.g., daily wage calculation or detecting unpaid leave days).
- **Leave Management:** Handle **Leave Applications** - when an employee requests a day off (sick leave, annual leave, etc.), they or the owner enters it into TOSS[\[54\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=How%20does%20ERPNext%20track%20employee,attendance). The system keeps track of how many leave days each employee has taken and has remaining (based on a leave policy you set, like 12 days per year). The owner can approve or reject leave requests. Approved leave can automatically mark those days as Absent (On Leave) in attendance to avoid double entry.
- **Payroll Processing:** Run **Payroll** at whatever frequency (monthly for most). TOSS can generate a **Payslip** for each employee[\[55\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=Can%20ERPNext%20handle%20payroll%20processing%3F). It will take their base salary or daily wage, add any allowances or deductions, and compute net pay. For example, it will automatically deduct for any unpaid absent days or add overtime if recorded, and calculate taxes if applicable (though for many small jobs taxes may not apply or be very simple). The owner reviews the payslips and then "submits" them, which posts the salary expense to accounting and sets an amount payable to the employee.
- **Salary Payments:** After finalizing payslips, record that you paid the salaries (if via cash, or bank transfer). This can be done by a **Payment Entry** to each employee or a batch "Bank Entry" if paying all at once. TOSS can mark the payslip as paid so you know who still needs to be paid. If integrated with a banking API, it could even initiate transfers, but likely not in MVP.
- **Expense Claims:** If employees spend on behalf of the company (e.g., buy stationery out of pocket), they can file an **Expense Claim** with receipts. The owner can approve and reimburse them through payroll or separately. This ensures those expenses are logged.
- **Optional - Recruitment:** If the business grows, an HR module could handle posting job openings and tracking applicants. Probably overkill for most small scenarios; not a focus unless needed later.
- **HR Reports & Documents:** Keep records like contracts, ID copies, etc., attached to employee records. Possibly generate standardized documents (like an offer letter or payslip PDF). Also reports such as who took how many sick days, etc.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Unique Employee ID:** Each employee has an ID or number. TOSS ensures no duplicate (e.g., two records for same person). Possibly a rule like one user/employee link if employees login to system (less likely in micro business).
- **Leave Balance Enforcement:** When approving a leave application, the system checks if the employee has enough leave balance for that leave type. If not, it can either deduct as unpaid or reject application, depending on policy.
- **Payroll Dependency on Attendance:** If using attendance, payroll calculation can be configured to use it. For example, if someone is daily wage or hourly, TOSS will sum their present days or hours. If someone has unpaid absences, it will prorate salary. So the rule: ensure attendance and leaves are marked before running payroll, otherwise payslip might overpay. The system might warn if generating a payslip while some attendance records are missing or unapproved leave exists.
- **Tax and Statutory Deductions:** If the business is registered for PAYE (income tax) or UIF (unemployment insurance) etc., the module can calculate those based on formulas/slabs. The rule is to use latest tax tables configured. For very small salaries under tax thresholds, it'll just skip tax. The system should also not deduct things like pension or medical unless set up. Simpler: if the payroll is straightforward (just wages, maybe one flat % tax), we configure that and TOSS applies it.
- **Payslip Approval:** Optionally, one might require a second person to approve payslips before payment. In micro setups, the owner both prepares and approves, so that might be redundant.
- **Confidentiality:** Salary info should ideally only be visible to the owner or authorized HR role, not all employees. If employees have access to self-service (like to apply leave or view their own payslip), TOSS ensures they can't see others' data.
- **Accruals & Year-End:** If not needed in cash-accounting small biz skip, but in background it might accrue salary expense to the month even if paid next month, etc., if books are kept by accrual. Possibly not a focus here.
- **Employee Exit:** If someone leaves, mark them as left on a certain date. TOSS then should exclude them from future payroll runs automatically and make their record inactive. Also it could compute any leave encashment or final pay if that's in scope.

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:**

- **Employee:** Fields - Employee ID, Full Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Contact info, Address, Date of Joining, Department (if any), Designation/Role, Employment Type (permanent/contract), Current Status (Active/Left), and perhaps a Leave Policy link and Salary Structure link.
- **Salary Structure/Payslip:** In ERPNext, you define a Salary Structure (components of pay) and then generate Payslips. For simplicity, TOSS might just store salary info in Employee (like monthly salary or hourly rate) and generate a payslip on the fly. But structure allows complexities (basic, allowances, etc.). Fields for Payslip - Employee, Period (month), components table (each entry: component name, amount, whether addition/deduction), Gross, Deductions, Net Pay, and status Paid/Unpaid[\[55\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=Can%20ERPNext%20handle%20payroll%20processing%3F).
- **Attendance:** Fields - Employee, Date, Status (Present/Absent/Half-Day/On Leave), maybe check-in/out times if capturing hours.
- **Leave Type:** Fields - Name (Annual Leave, Sick Leave, etc.), total days allowed, whether carry forward allowed, whether is paid or not.
- **Leave Allocation:** Could define per employee how many days of each leave they get per year. Or use a default if all get same. Fields - Employee, Leave Type, Period (year), Allocated Days.
- **Leave Application:** Fields - Employee, Leave Type, From Date, To Date, Reason, Status (Applied/Pending, Approved, Rejected). The system calculates number of days.
- **Expense Claim:** Fields - Employee, details of expenses (could be child table of items with amount), total, status (to reimburse or paid).
- **Holiday List:** Possibly define public holidays so attendance auto-marks or not considered absences. Could default a country holiday list if needed.
- **Payroll Settings:** Could include things like work days per month (for pro-rate), default accounts for salary booking, etc.

**User Interface & Experience:** The HR module, being sensitive, might not be used by all employees on the system except for maybe a self-service portal for leave. The owner or manager will use it to run payroll and manage leave.

On the **Employee List**, you see all employees with maybe status and key info. Clicking one shows their profile - which can have tabs like Personal Info, Salary Info (e.g., monthly salary, maybe stored as a component), Leave Balances (display each type and remaining days).

For attendance, if used, the UI could be a simple calendar grid: each employee as row and dates as columns, where you tick P/A. Or the employee can have an "Attendance" form for each day. Might be easier: a daily attendance form where owner selects date, and then marks each employee present or absent in a list and saves. TOSS auto-fills defaults (everyone present unless ticked absent, for example).

The **Leave Application** UI for an employee (if allowed self-service) would be a simple form: pick dates, type, reason, submit. The owner then sees a notification or a list of leave requests to approve. Approving one automatically updates that employee's leave balance and can mark those days in attendance as leave (not counted as absence for payroll).

**Payroll** UI should be simple: likely a wizard or a button "Process Payroll for \[Month\]". The system will gather each active employee, calculate their earnings/deductions. The owner can review a summary (like a table of employees vs net pay) and click each if detail needed. Then finalize all payslips with one action. After that, a step to "Make Payments" - perhaps listing all payslips with option to create a Bank Advice or mark as paid one by one. If it's cash salaries, maybe the owner clicks "Mark all as Paid (Cash)" after physically paying them.

Payslips can be printed or emailed to employees. The format should be clean, showing gross, each deduction, net, and employer info. TOSS can generate these PDFs.

The **Reports** include e.g., a Leave Balance report (who has how many days left), an Attendance report, payroll register (list of all pay amounts for a period). Possibly compliance reports if needed, like a summary to fill on statutory forms.

**Offline Capabilities:** HR tasks like running payroll likely will be done online in office. But what about, say, marking attendance on a job site? Possibly a supervisor could tick attendance offline on their device and sync later. Or an employee could apply leave offline (not likely unless app is used in no-signal area, but could happen). These are not high-frequency urgent actions, so offline support is not critical but nice to have.

If offline, the request would just queue and send on connectivity. For attendance, if offline, one could mark present, and when sync occurs, it populates the central record. Usually there's no conflict unless two people marked something differently (which wouldn't happen unless the owner and supervisor both independently mark attendance, in which case one will override - but small teams likely coordinate that).

Payslips likely require connection to fetch latest data and push to accounts, so that's an online activity. If the owner had to run payroll without net, maybe they could do it offline and print locally, but syncing to accounting would wait until online.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Amina runs a small salon with 3 employees: two hairdressers and one assistant. She uses HR module to manage them. At the start, she created Employee records for each with their join date and monthly wage. The salon is closed on Mondays and none works that day, so she configured a Holiday List for Mondays and public holidays so those don't count as absences.

Every morning, she quickly notes attendance. The default setting in TOSS marks everyone Present by default; if someone is out, she opens that day in the Attendance tool and marks that employee Absent. Last Tuesday, her assistant, Thandi, called in sick. Amina opened TOSS and created a **Leave Application** for Thandi - from Tuesday to Wednesday as sick leave (two days)[\[54\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=How%20does%20ERPNext%20track%20employee,attendance). She marked it as Approved. TOSS deducted those from Thandi's sick leave balance (she gets 5 sick days per year; now 3 left) and tagged those two days so payroll won't pay them (Amina's policy is unpaid sick days for part-timers).

At end of the month, Amina runs **Payroll**. She clicks "Process Payroll for March". TOSS generates payslips: each hairdresser at R5,000 (no absences, so full pay), Thandi's pay is usually R3,000 but the system sees 2 unpaid sick days (it knows from attendance/leave) and deducts R200 (say her wage ~R100/day) so shows R2,800 gross[\[55\]](https://9t9it.com/eprnext-faq#:~:text=Can%20ERPNext%20handle%20payroll%20processing%3F). It also calculates a small tax for one hairdresser who is above tax threshold (let's say R50 tax).

She reviews and then submits the payslips. Accounting entries are posted (debit salary expense ~R12,800, credit salary payable). She then records **Payment**: she pays cash, so she marks all as paid from the business cash account (TOSS could let her do this in one go or one by one). Now the liability clears and cash is reduced accordingly in accounts.

Each employee gets their payslip via WhatsApp (she exported PDF from TOSS mobile and sent it, or if they had email, email). They can see clearly their earnings and any deductions. Thandi sees 2 days unpaid noted, which matches their earlier discussion.

Over time, Amina uses reports like "Monthly Attendance" to see patterns - maybe one staff has frequent Mondays off beyond holidays. She might counsel them about reliability. The Leave Balance report at year-end shows one hairdresser didn't use any leave; she encourages her to take a break (to avoid burnout).

Because payroll data is in TOSS, when Amina needed income verification for a loan, she quickly pulled a **Payroll Register** report for last 6 months, demonstrating she pays salaries regularly - this helped her credibility.

In the network context, if her salon staff wanted to join a collective insurance plan, having formal payslips and records from TOSS made it easy to prove employment and income. Also, if a staff member works at two shops in the network (maybe part-time at each), the HR module could handle that by two employee entries or a shared one if network allowed linking - but at least records exist.

For Amina, HR module took away the headache of remembering who took leave or how to prorate pay - TOSS handled it, and employees are confident in the accuracy of their pay.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** AI in HR acts like a smart HR assistant. It can watch patterns in attendance and suggest improvements or alerts. For example, _"Thandi has taken 5 sick days in 2 months, higher than average - check if there are underlying issues or if help is needed."_ Or _"Lebo often works overtime on Saturdays - ensure she's compensated or consider adjusting staffing on weekends."_

AI can also assist with **scheduling**. An example: based on sales patterns or footfall (from POS data), AI might suggest optimal staffing: _"Fridays are very busy in the salon; consider having an extra helper on Fridays (maybe part-time) to improve customer service."_ Conversely, _"Wednesdays are slow - you might not need both hairdressers full-day, could rotate or have one focus on marketing."_ This crosses HR with sales insights.

For leave management, AI might forecast workload vs staff availability. If many staff request overlap leave, it can warn: _"Two employees requested leave on the same week next month - your available workforce will be 1, which might be insufficient given last month's bookings. You may need to decline or hire temp help."_

On performance, if any KPI data is integrated (like sales per stylist), AI could highlight who's performing well or needing support, which in HR context might influence training or rewards: _"Stylist A's services bring in 30% more revenue than peers - consider bonus or asking them to share techniques."_ or _"Stylist B has lower customer retention (from CRM feedback) - perhaps provide additional training."_

AI can also help ensure compliance: reminding about things like _"It's been a year, time to renew Worker X's contract"_ or _"Check if all employees' certifications (first aid, etc.) are up to date."_ If any labour regulations (like minimum wage changes or leave accrual rules) change and are input, AI might notify the owner to adjust salaries or structures accordingly.

For payroll, AI could verify anomalies: _"This month's total payroll is 20% higher than last - did you add staff or might there be an error?"_ or detect if someone's pay is consistently docked for overtime/absences, to prompt a conversation.

**Collaborative Network Features:** In a network, HR could be leveraged for **shared talent pools** and **benefit programs**. For instance, the network might maintain a centralized roster of vetted part-time or fill-in workers (accountants, drivers, etc.) who can be temporarily employed by any member. Through TOSS, a business could request an extra hand; the network HR could then assign someone (turning them into an "Employee" of that business for a day or handle payment centrally). The system would ensure that worker's total hours across the network are tracked so they aren't over-committed. Payment could be done by the network central and then billed to the business, or directly by the hiring business - TOSS is flexible but facilitates these records.

Another angle is **collective bargaining** for employees' welfare. If the network uses TOSS to aggregate HR data, they know how many people are employed in total and maybe their salary ranges. They could approach an insurance for group health cover. TOSS could then manage the deductions from payroll for those who opt in. For example, if 50 employees across network join a medical scheme, each one's payroll in TOSS will have a deduction line (and a central account in network books pays the insurer).

The network might also run **training sessions** (like customer service training or safety training). Through TOSS HR, they can schedule and track attendance for these among member employees. Employee records could have certifications listed, so the network can quickly see who from any member has a certain certification if a project needs it.

Additionally, if an employee moves between businesses in the network (common in informal sectors - e.g., a good cashier might go from Shop A to manage Shop B opened by another member), having their performance history or basic info portable can help. With permission, an employee's record (sans confidential bits) could be shared to the new employer in the network. Essentially, a mini reference that's verified through the network's HR. The network might thus build a reputation system for workers: reliable staff could find jobs with other member businesses easily (like an internal LinkedIn). The HR module could have a flag or note visible to network HR admins: e.g., "This cashier was trained on POS and had excellent attendance at Shop A."

For compliance and advocacy, the network can use aggregated HR data to ensure fair labor practices. If one business is underpaying below minimum wage, the network might intervene (assuming open sharing or an audit). Or the network can negotiate group rates for payroll services, retirement funds, etc., using the power of numbers. TOSS providing clear, aggregate stats (e.g., "Our network employs 200 people with total monthly payroll of R500k") strengthens their position in such negotiations or in representing the informal sector's employment contribution in discussions with authorities.

In summary, while each business manages its own employees day-to-day, the network can uplift the quality of employment by pooling resources - from training to insurance - and TOSS HR gives the data backbone to do that fairly and efficiently, all while protecting individual businesses' confidentiality where needed.

## Support (Helpdesk & Customer Support Module)

**Functional Overview & Purpose:** The Support module provides a system for **managing customer issues and inquiries**. It allows businesses to log customer complaints or requests (often called tickets or issues), track their status, and ensure timely resolution. Even small businesses benefit from a lightweight helpdesk: for instance, a small electronics shop can track warranty repair cases, or a co-op can handle support requests from members. This module helps maintain good customer service by making sure every query is recorded and addressed and by building a knowledge base of solutions for common problems[\[57\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,manage%20tickets%20by%20connecting%20your).

**Core Workflows:**

- **Issue/Ticket Logging:** When a customer reaches out with a problem (product defect, service complaint, question), create a **Support Issue** in TOSS[\[57\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,manage%20tickets%20by%20connecting%20your). Capture the customer, date, and details of the issue. Issues can come via many channels: phone calls (manually logged), emails (could be auto-converted to issues if integrated), website form (feeding into support), or walk-ins (staff logs it).
- **Issue Assignment & Categorization:** Categorize the issue (e.g., _Billing_, _Technical_, _General Inquiry_) and assign it to the person or team responsible[\[57\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,manage%20tickets%20by%20connecting%20your). In a tiny business, that might always be the owner or a specific employee. You can set priority (Low/Med/High/Urgent) depending on severity (e.g., "Fridge not cooling - urgent if under warranty"), so urgent ones are addressed first.
- **Communication & Resolution:** Use the issue to track all communications. You can reply to the customer (if via email, TOSS can send emails and capture their replies under the issue), or note that you called them and what was discussed[\[91\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,important%20and%20urgent%20they%20are). The aim is to keep a full history. As you work on the problem, update the status: e.g., _"Identified cause - part needs replacement, awaiting part"_ (maybe a custom status On Hold), then _"Resolved"_ once fixed. Possibly the customer can be notified at each stage automatically.
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** If you promise customers certain response/resolve times, configure those. The system will then monitor each ticket against the SLA (using timestamps)[\[60\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,that%20have%20already%20been%20set). If a ticket is breaching its SLA (e.g., not responded within 24h for high priority), it can escalate - maybe by highlighting in red or notifying a manager. In a small biz, escalation might just mean it bugs the owner with an extra alert.
- **Knowledge Base & FAQs:** Over time, build a **Knowledge Base** of common questions and their answers or known fixes[\[61\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,tickets%20by%20connecting%20your%20email). Support agents can link an issue to a Knowledge Base article or quickly search it to answer. Possibly, this can be exposed on the website for customers to self-help. For example, an article "How to troubleshoot a fridge that's not cooling" that customers can read instead of calling.
- **Maintenance Visits/Service:** If support involves physical service (like sending a technician), the Support module can schedule a **Maintenance Visit**. That might be integrated with Projects or a calendar. E.g., for a warranty repair, create a visit record under the issue with date and who will go. Once done, close it.
- **Feedback & Closure:** After resolving an issue, you might capture customer feedback (rating or comment). The module could send a quick "Was your issue resolved satisfactorily?" or just mark as closed. Good to gather if customers are happy, and if not, maybe reopen or escalate further.

**Business Rules & Validation:**

- **Unique Ticket IDs:** Each issue gets an auto ID (like SUP-1001) to reference easily. If a customer calls about the same issue, support should use the same ticket rather than creating duplicates - search by customer or by keywords helps avoid duplication.
- **Customer Link:** Ideally every issue is linked to a Customer record (or at least a name and contact captured). This way, one can see all issues that customer had historically, which helps in understanding their needs or frustration level.
- **Status Flow:** Usually, New → Open → Resolved → Closed. The system enforces some flows: e.g., you shouldn't close without marking resolved or having a resolution note. Or if reopened, status goes back to Open. Each transition might capture time stamps (for SLA calculations).
- **Time Logging:** If needed, record time spent on tickets (could integrate with timesheets if billing for support or just to track workload). This might be heavy for a microbiz unless they bill clients for service time.
- **SLA timers:** The system should automatically start timers when ticket is logged. If "Response SLA = 4 hours", once 4 hours passes with no agent response posted, it flags escalation. Similarly, a "Resolve SLA = 24 hours" would count down from open to closed. Holidays and off-hours can be configured to not count if needed (maybe not for microbiz, but the capability exists).
- **Priority Handling:** If a ticket is marked Urgent, maybe the system alerts the support person immediately (SMS or special sound) versus low priority might just sit in queue. Should be visual indicators as well.
- **Knowledge Base Quality:** Possibly require that if an issue is recurring, a KB article is created. But small scale maybe not needed. At least ensure KB articles are reviewed and approved (so customers don't see incorrect info). Perhaps each article has a status draft/published.
- **Customer Updates:** After any meaningful change, ideally the customer should be informed. The system can send an email or text based on triggers (e.g., "Your support ticket #123 has been resolved. If you're satisfied, let us know."). Ensure that the communication uses simple language.
- **Integration with Inventory/Service:** If resolving an issue required issuing a spare part from inventory or creating a sales invoice (if out of warranty and chargeable), the system should allow linking that. E.g., you open an issue, decide it needs a replacement part, you can create a Delivery Note or Sales Invoice from the issue to bill that part, and it's all linked. The rule is to capture any financial impact of support in the system.
- **Privacy:** Keep any sensitive info (like a customer's logs or attachments) accessible only to authorized users, in case multiple people use the system. Also comply if a customer asks to delete their data (POPIA/GDPR compliance) - typically uncommon in such context but good practice.

**Required Data Models & Key Fields:**

- **Issue/Ticket:** Fields - Issue ID, Subject, Description (the problem detail), Customer (link or at least name/phone), Status, Priority, Type/Category, Assigned To (user handling it), Opening Date, Response Deadline (if SLA), Resolve Deadline, and fields to record Response Time and Resolve Time actual. Could also have an Impact or Product field if needed (e.g., which product was this about).
- **Issue Communication:** Each ticket would have a timeline of communications. Likely stored as a Communication doctype with fields: Issue ID (link), Date, Sender/Recipient, Medium (Email/Phone/Note), Content (message text or call summary), and perhaps an indicator if this satisfies first response.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** Possibly a doctype or config where you define rules: e.g., Priority = High → Respond in 2 hrs, Resolve in 8 hrs. It can also have business hours defined. The issue picks an SLA based on category or customer maybe.
- **Maintenance Visit:** If needed, a doctype with Issue link, Assigned Employee, Date, and a status (Scheduled, Completed) plus a report/notes field to fill what was done.
- **Knowledge Base Article (Solution):** Fields - Title, Content (rich text with images possibly), Category (FAQ, Troubleshooting, etc.), Issue Link (if it was created from a specific issue), Published (yes/no). Possibly a separate portal for customers to browse these.
- **Feedback/Rating:** Could be a simple child of Issue or a field: like Rating 1-5, Comments. Might be filled by agent after asking customer or via a form link the customer gets.

**User Interface & Experience:** The Support interface prominently shows open tickets. A small business might have just a handful at a time, but it's key none get forgotten. The **Issue List** could be by default filtered to Open tickets, showing columns like ID, Subject, Customer, Priority, Age (time since opened), and who's assigned. Overdue ones might be highlighted or sorted up.

When clicking an issue, you see the full details and a conversation thread. Much like a email client or chat: the customer query at top, then support's response, etc., in order. The agent can type a reply in a rich text box if emailing out (with option to pick a solution from KB to insert). Or if the customer is on phone, the agent can instead click "Add Comment" and note what was discussed or promised.

To speed up solving, a sidebar could show related knowledge base suggestions (e.g., search knowledge base by issue keywords)[\[61\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,tickets%20by%20connecting%20your%20email). The agent might just copy-paste an answer from an article to reply if it fits.

There may also be canned actions: "Mark as Resolved" button which prompts to add a resolution note and set status = Resolved in one go. If the process is the owner usually takes care of all, they might not even assign, but just use status and priority.

If the business has a website, a simplified **Support Form** can be embedded, which on submission creates an Issue in TOSS. The owner sees it and responds via TOSS sending an email.

Support module could integrate with WhatsApp via Twilio or similar - but for MVP probably not. Likely use email as primary digital channel, plus manual logging for calls.

**Offline Capabilities:** Support agents (like the owner or a staff) might get calls when not connected to the system. They can still note down the issue and later create the ticket in TOSS (backdated creation time). There's not much need for real-time offline usage except maybe if on-site service where no internet, they can open the ticket info offline (e.g., check knowledge base while at client site). If they update it offline (like closing a ticket after fixing on site), it syncs later so central records update.

If SMS/WhatsApp integration is considered, offline won't send those - they'd queue until online.

**Example Use Case (Township Context):** \*Sello runs a small electronics repair shop and sells appliances. He uses Support module to track warranty and repair cases.

One of his customers, Naledi, bought a fridge 3 months ago and now it's not cooling. Naledi calls Sello. Sello opens TOSS Support on his laptop and **creates a new Issue**: "Fridge not cooling - Naledi Dube"[\[57\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,manage%20tickets%20by%20connecting%20your). He fills in her phone number and selects category "Product Defect" and marks priority as High (since a fridge issue is urgent due to food spoilage). He assigns it to himself (by default).

He tells Naledi he'll send a technician. He then clicks "Maintenance Visit" on the ticket and schedules a visit for that afternoon. The system captures that as an appointment associated with the issue, and he sets the issue status to "In Progress" (since it's being handled). If he had an SLA (say respond within 1hr, resolve in 1 day for warranty issues), the system would count - in this case, he responded immediately by phone, so he logs a note "Spoke to Naledi, scheduled technician today 3pm" - which satisfies the response SLA[\[60\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,that%20have%20already%20been%20set).

His technician, Thabo, goes to Naledi's place, checks the fridge. The cause: a faulty thermostat. Thabo has a spare part. He replaces it on site. He updates Sello via WhatsApp, and back in the system, Sello opens the issue and records an Internal Note: "Thermostat replaced by Thabo on-site, fridge cooling now." He sets the status to **Resolved**. This triggers TOSS to send an SMS to Naledi: "Your issue #FR-1001 has been resolved. If you need further help, contact us." (Assuming he set up an SMS integration for notifications).

Naledi calls the next day to confirm it's working fine, and thanks him. Sello then **closes** the ticket on TOSS. He also has TOSS record that this was a warranty case - no charge to customer, but he does log under the ticket's costs the thermostat part (R200 from his stock). That way, he can later see how many warranty parts he's giving out.

Over time, Sello notices several fridge issues of the same model for thermostat failure. Using Support's simple reports, he sees 5 similar tickets in two months. That's a pattern. He writes a **Knowledge Base article**: "Fridge Model X not cooling - thermostat issue" describing the symptom and fix[\[61\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,tickets%20by%20connecting%20your%20email). This helps him or his staff handle future cases faster (and he might press the supplier for better parts or compensation). If customers check his website's help section, they might see this article too and realize it's a known issue (which might either reassure them it can be fixed or push the supplier to recall).

If Sello's business was part of a network, he could also share these support patterns. E.g., other electronics shops in network also log fridge issues - together they compile a **common solution database** and collectively approach the fridge manufacturer about the defect, using data of how many cases occurred (TOSS can generate that report easily from issues across network members).

For now, Sello is just happy that nothing falls through: every customer issue is tracked, even if he can't fix it immediately, it's on his list. His customers are happier because they see he has a system - they get updates and their problems aren't forgotten in the busy shuffle.\*

**SaaS 2.0 - AI & Insights:** AI in Support can significantly improve response quality and speed. One main feature is **suggested solutions**: as soon as an issue is logged (or as the agent types the complaint), the AI can search the knowledge base and past tickets for similar keywords[\[61\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,tickets%20by%20connecting%20your%20email). It might pop up: _"Likely cause: Thermostat failure - see Solution #212"_. This saves Sello's time in figuring out the problem. If integrated with something like GPT, it could even draft a tailored answer to the customer based on the knowledge base.

AI can also categorize and prioritize tickets automatically (NLP). E.g., if a message says "fridge not working and food spoiling, very upset!", the AI could label it Urgent and type "Product Defect" without Sello manually doing it. It might even detect sentiment (customer is angry)[\[91\]](https://zikpro.frappe.cloud/ERPNext-Helpdesk#:~:text=,important%20and%20urgent%20they%20are) and alert Sello to handle carefully.

For SLA, AI can forecast if a ticket is at risk of breaching. It knows Sello's usual resolution times and backlog. It might warn: _"You have 5 open high-priority issues and typically resolve 2 per day; some may breach SLA without extra help."_ This could prompt him to maybe call in a freelance tech from network for a day.

AI could facilitate a **self-service chatbot**. If a customer goes to Sello's website, a bot could ask what's wrong, then pull answers from knowledge base to help them (using an NLP model). For instance, _Customer:_ "My fridge isn't cold." _Bot:_ "Is the light on? \[Yes\] Have you tried adjusting thermostat? \[Yes\] It might be a thermostat failure, which we can repair under warranty. Please contact us for a service visit."_ If the bot can't help, it logs an issue for a human follow-up. This reduces trivial tickets.

Also, across the network, AI can identify product issues trending. E.g., _"15 issues about Model X fridge not cooling across the network in last month (5 yours, 10 others). Likely a widespread defect_[_\[51\]_](https://github.com/Toss-Online-Services/TossErp/blob/10c8061dab87e2b12429c455fe4113e62a69f8e0/toss-web/server/data/modules.ts#L360-L364)_."_ It might alert all network support agents or suggest proactively reaching out to customers who bought that model (sales records can be cross-referenced) to offer a fix before it fails - turning support into a preventive service and good customer care.

AI can optimize support scheduling too: if multiple service visits in the same area come in, it can group them for Thabo on one trip (like a route optimization for field service).

Finally, AI monitors customer satisfaction. If a particular issue type is taking too long to resolve on average or certain customers have repeated issues, it surfaces that: _"Customer Naledi had 3 issues in 3 months - maybe follow up for product replacement or goodwill gesture."_ Or _"Tickets about microwave ovens often reopen - check if initial solutions are effective."_

**Collaborative Network Features:** Support is an area where collaboration can shine, especially for knowledge sharing and load balancing:

- **Shared Knowledge Base:** The network can maintain a central KB that all members contribute to and use. Suppose there are many small electronics shops; they all log their support issues and solutions. Over time, a rich repository of problems and fixes is built (like "common TV faults and fixes"). New or less experienced members benefit from this collective wisdom when they encounter issues - they search the network KB and find solutions discovered by others. TOSS can handle permissions so certain internal notes may remain private if desired, but generally everyone gains.
- **Specialist Escalation:** If one member can't solve an issue (maybe they lack advanced diagnostic tools), they could escalate it to a network specialist. In TOSS, that could mean transferring the ticket to another company (like how one might escalate to tier-2 support). For instance, Shop A gets a complex computer repair issue they can't fix, they escalate the ticket to Shop B's expert. The ticket in TOSS would change owner (and possibly company context). Shop B fixes it and either returns the item or instructs Shop A. The network might have an agreed billing for such help. TOSS would allow linking this to an inter-company invoice possibly (Shop B charges Shop A for the service at an agreed rate). But to the customer, it's seamless - their issue gets solved, via network cooperation.
- **Network Ticket Pool:** If one support center is swamped, the network could have an overflow mechanism. For example, an online marketplace run by the network fields customer queries about orders. Those tickets could be answered by any available agent across the network, not just one central team. In TOSS, a ticket could be visible in a "network queue" where multiple support agents from different members can pick and resolve them (especially if they are generic questions or follow-ups). This is kind of cross-company task assignment, which the platform could allow through a shared support space.
- **Unified Customer Support Experience:** The network may present a unified front for support. E.g., "Township Tech Support Line" for all electronics purchased from any member. Customers call one number, tickets are logged, and then TOSS routes it to the specific seller or a network helpdesk. From a customer view, it's one entity, but internally, TOSS knows which company is responsible and assigns accordingly. This requires integration of data so the helpdesk can see sale records to verify warranty etc., which a network central system could query from members' data if allowed.
- **Collective SLA Commitment:** The network might promise certain service levels (like all members in the network guarantee 24h response to complaints). TOSS can help monitor each member's compliance. If someone is lagging, network leadership can intervene or assist (maybe they need training or resources). It keeps the whole network's reputation up when everyone meets the standard.
- **Cost Sharing & Bulk Contracts:** For example, network could have a deal with a courier for handling returns or field service logistics. Support module knows how many on-site visits or returns happened network-wide (from Maintenance Visit entries). They could collectively negotiate better rates for those with a courier.
- **Community Support Initiatives:** Perhaps the network runs a community helpdesk for certain services (like tech advice clinics on weekends). TOSS support could track those inquiries too, giving insight into community needs that might inform business opportunities.

In conclusion, the Support module in a network context not only improves each business's customer service but binds them into a support ecosystem where knowledge and effort is shared. It ensures small businesses can provide reliable, efficient support on par with bigger companies, by collectively leveraging their strengths and learning, thereby boosting customer confidence and satisfaction across the board.
