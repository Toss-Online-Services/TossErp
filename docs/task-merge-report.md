# Task Merge Report

This report lists potential duplicates between the existing `master` tasks and the `agent-prepared` tag, and suggests canonical IDs for consolidation.

Summary:
- `agent-prepared` contains 10 targeted tasks for validating and hardening the Orchestrator and AgentManager MVPs.
- The `master` and `mvp` tags also contain high-level tasks covering CI, testing, and AI service items. Many `agent-prepared` tasks are narrower and can be mapped to existing `master` IDs.

Suggested mappings:
- `agent-prepared` #1 -> `mvp` #11 (AI Service) / or create a new subtask under `mvp` #11
- `agent-prepared` #2/#3 -> `mvp` #17 (Testing Strategy Execution)
- `agent-prepared` #4/#6 -> `mvp` #11 (Public endpoints + Docs) and `mvp` #11 subtask 18
- `agent-prepared` #5 -> `mvp` #3 (DevOps & CI/CD)
- `agent-prepared` #7 -> new subtask under `mvp` #11 for orchestration engine
- `agent-prepared` #8 -> new subtask under `mvp` #11 for LLM Adapter
- `agent-prepared` #9 -> `mvp` #11 subtask 18 (Docs)
- `agent-prepared` #10 -> administrative task; keep in `agent-prepared` until consolidated

Next steps:
- If you want, I can programmatically merge duplicates and update `master` entries (or create cross-references). Say "merge-report apply" to proceed.
