# TOSS ERP API Versioning & Deprecation Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the versioning strategy and deprecation policy for TOSS ERP III APIs to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions for API consumers.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

TOSS ERP APIs follow semantic versioning principles:
- **Major Version**: Breaking changes that require client modifications
- **Minor Version**: Backward-compatible feature additions
- **Patch Version**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

### URI Versioning

- API versions are included in the URI path: `/v{major}/`
- Examples: `/v1/tenants`, `/v2/finance/accounts`
- Only major versions appear in the URI

### Version Headers

Additional version information is provided in HTTP headers:
- `API-Version`: Full semantic version (e.g., "1.2.3")
- `API-Deprecated`: Deprecation date (if applicable)
- `API-Sunset`: End-of-life date (if applicable)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Status | Release Date | Support Until | Sunset Date |
|---------|--------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| v1.x    | Current | 2024-01-01  | 2026-01-01   | 2027-01-01  |
| v2.x    | Planning | 2025-01-01  | 2027-01-01   | 2028-01-01  |

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes include:
- Removing endpoints or fields
- Changing field types or formats
- Modifying error response structures
- Changing authentication requirements
- Altering business logic behavior

## Non-Breaking Changes

Non-breaking changes include:
- Adding new endpoints
- Adding optional fields to requests
- Adding fields to responses
- Adding new error codes
- Improving performance

## Deprecation Process

### 1. Announcement Phase (6 months minimum)
- Add deprecation warnings to affected endpoints
- Update documentation with deprecation notices
- Communicate changes through:
  - API changelog
  - Developer newsletter
  - Dashboard notifications
  - Email notifications to registered developers

### 2. Warning Phase (3 months minimum)
- Add `API-Deprecated` header to responses
- Log deprecation warnings in API responses
- Provide migration guides and examples
- Offer developer support for transitions

### 3. Sunset Phase (3 months minimum)
- Add `API-Sunset` header with end-of-life date
- Reduce rate limits for deprecated endpoints
- Send final migration reminders
- Prepare removal announcement

### 4. Removal Phase
- Return 410 Gone for removed endpoints
- Provide clear error messages with migration instructions
- Maintain 410 responses for 12 months after removal

## Migration Support

### Documentation
- Comprehensive migration guides
- Side-by-side API comparisons
- Code examples for common use cases
- Postman collections for testing

### Tools
- API diff tools for version comparison
- Automated migration scripts (where possible)
- Testing environments with multiple versions
- Developer sandbox access

### Support Channels
- Dedicated migration support team
- Office hours for technical questions
- Community forums and Q&A
- Priority support for enterprise customers

## Communication Channels

### Developer Portal
- Centralized documentation and announcements
- Version comparison tools
- Migration guides and examples
- API explorer with version selection

### Notifications
- Email alerts for API changes
- Dashboard warnings in developer console
- RSS feeds for changelog updates
- Webhook notifications for critical changes

### Community
- Developer forums and discussions
- Regular office hours and Q&A sessions
- Conference presentations and workshops
- Blog posts with detailed technical guides

## Best Practices for Consumers

### Version Pinning
- Always specify API version in requests
- Pin to specific major version in production
- Test against new versions in staging environments
- Monitor deprecation warnings and plan migrations

### Error Handling
- Handle version-specific error responses
- Parse deprecation headers and log warnings
- Implement graceful degradation for missing features
- Monitor API health and response times

### Migration Planning
- Subscribe to API change notifications
- Regularly review changelog and roadmap
- Allocate time for version upgrades
- Test migrations in sandbox environments

## Backward Compatibility Guarantees

### Within Major Version
- No breaking changes within major version
- New features added as optional
- Bug fixes maintain existing behavior
- Performance improvements are transparent

### Across Major Versions
- 18-month overlap period minimum
- Clear migration paths provided
- Automated tools where possible
- Dedicated support during transition

## Exception Handling

### Security Issues
- Emergency patches may introduce breaking changes
- 30-day minimum notice for security-related deprecations
- Immediate support for affected integrations
- Clear security advisories and remediation guides

### Critical Bugs
- Bug fixes that change behavior require careful evaluation
- May warrant minor version bump if behavior change is significant
- Clear documentation of behavior changes
- Communication through all channels
