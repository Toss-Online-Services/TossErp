# Logistics API

Reference: See shared API standards in ../api-specs/STANDARDS.md for authentication, headers, RFC9457 errors, cursor pagination, idempotency keys, rate limits, webhooks, and auditing.

## Security & Scopes
- OAuth2 scopes: logistics:read, logistics:write, shipment:write
- Warehouse/carrier/shipper scoping on queries

## Common Headers
- Authorization: Bearer <token>
- Idempotency-Key: required on POSTs that create/modify state (shipment create/update, scans, inventory transfers)
- X-Request-Id for tracing

## Resource Model (high-level)
- Shipment: id, order_ref, origin, destination, items[], status, events[], carrier
- Warehouse: id, name, location, capacity, status
- InventoryMove: id, warehouse_id, sku, qty, batch/serial, status, doc_refs

## Endpoints

- Responses: 201 Created; 409 invalid transitions or duplicate scans; Webhook scan.recorded or shipment.updated

### POST /warehouses/{id}/inventory-moves

## Errors & Conflicts
- RFC9457

## Webhooks
- shipment.created, shipment.updated, shipment.delivered, scan.recorded
- HMAC-signed per standards
