# Asset Sharing API

Reference: See shared API standards in ../api-specs/STANDARDS.md for authentication, headers, RFC9457 errors, cursor pagination, idempotency keys, rate limits, webhooks, and auditing.

## Security & Scopes
- OAuth2 scopes: asset:read, asset:write, booking:write
- Role/location-based scoping for assets and bookings

## Common Headers
- Authorization: Bearer <token>
- Idempotency-Key: required on POSTs that create/modify state (asset create, booking, check-in/out, condition reports)
- X-Request-Id: optional caller-generated for tracing

## Resource Model (high-level)
- Asset: id, name, category, owner_org_id, location_id, booking_terms, maintenance_schedule, status, created_at, updated_at, etag
- Booking: id, asset_id, user_id, start, end, status, cost_minor, currency, approvals[], created_at, updated_at
- ConditionReport: id, asset_id, booking_id, checklist[], photos[], notes, status, created_at
- Maintenance: id, asset_id, type, due_at, status
