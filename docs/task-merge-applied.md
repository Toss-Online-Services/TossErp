# Task Merge Applied

This document summarizes the consolidation mappings applied by the agent on 2025-08-20.

Mappings added to `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` under the `agent-prepared` tag as `consolidatedInto` fields:

- agent-prepared#1 -> mvp#11 subtask#1 (Verify scaffolds consolidated into AI Service docs/exports)
- agent-prepared#2 -> mvp#17 subtask#1 (Unit tests consolidated into Testing Strategy)
- agent-prepared#3 -> mvp#17 subtask#2 (Integration harness consolidated into Testing Strategy)
- agent-prepared#4 -> mvp#11 subtask#18 (OpenAPI generation consolidated into AI Service docs)
- agent-prepared#5 -> mvp#3 subtask#2 (CI workflow consolidated into DevOps & CI/CD)
- agent-prepared#6 -> mvp#11 subtask#18 (OpenAPI client generation consolidated into AI Service docs)
- agent-prepared#7 -> mvp#11 subtask#16 (Temporal scaffold consolidated into AI Service subtasks)
- agent-prepared#8 -> mvp#11 subtask#2 (LLMAdapter stub consolidated into AI Service subtasks)
- agent-prepared#9 -> mvp#19 subtask#1 (Run/dev docs consolidated into Documentation tasks)
- agent-prepared#10 -> master#20 (Taskmaster sync consolidated into Performance Optimization & Final Testing)

Notes:
- These mappings are non-destructive references. The `agent-prepared` tasks remain for traceability and now include `consolidatedInto` pointers to canonical tasks in `mvp` or `master` contexts.
- If you want the agent to automatically move or remove the agent-prepared tasks after confirmation, reply with "apply-and-remove" and I will perform that change.
