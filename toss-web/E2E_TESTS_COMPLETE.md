## Key Testing Patterns Implemented

### 1. Authentication Pattern
```typescript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login')
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'admin@example.com')
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password')
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]')
  await page.waitForURL('/dashboard')
})
```

### 2. Search Pattern
```typescript
const searchInput = page.locator('input[placeholder*="Search"]')
await searchInput.fill('search term')
await page.waitForTimeout(500)
await expect(page.locator('table tbody tr')).toHaveCount(expectedCount)
```

### 3. Filter Pattern
```typescript
const statusFilter = page.locator('select:has-text("All Status")')
await statusFilter.selectOption('Desired Status')
await page.waitForTimeout(300)
```

### 4. Data Verification Pattern
```typescript
await expect(page.locator('text=Expected Data')).toBeVisible()
await expect(page.locator('table tbody tr')).toHaveCount(5)
```
