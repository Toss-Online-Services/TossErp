```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Follow the prompts:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Build Fails
```bash
rm -rf node_modules .nuxt .output
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run generate
```

### Deployment Fails
1. Check Vercel CLI is installed: `vercel --version`
2. Try: `npm install -g vercel`
3. Clear cache: `vercel --debug`
4. Check vercel.json syntax

### PWA Not Installing
- Must be on HTTPS (Vercel provides automatically)
- Check manifest at `your-url.vercel.app/manifest.json`
- Verify service worker at `your-url.vercel.app/sw.js`
- Check DevTools → Application → Manifest

### Pages Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all routes in `.output/public/`
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Ensure mock services imported correctly

### Mock Data Not Showing
- Check `services/mock/` files exist
- Verify `useApi.ts` has mock imports
- Check browser network tab (should show no real API calls)
- Verify console for errors
