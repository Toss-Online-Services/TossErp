- Glass morphism header with backdrop blur
- Modern card designs with shadows and borders
- Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Gradient text headings (blue → purple)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Props for OrderTimeline Component
```typescript
{
  orderNumber: string     // e.g., "PO-1761045935289"
  status: string          // "pending" | "approved" | "in-transit" | "delivered"
  orderDate: Date         // When order was placed
  expectedDelivery?: Date // Optional: When delivery is expected
}
```

### Timeline Logic
- Automatically calculates which steps are complete based on `status`
- Generates estimated timestamps for each stage
- Color codes icons based on completion
- Shows "awaiting..." text for pending stages

### Data Sources
1. **localStorage** - `toss-orders` key
2. **Query Params** - `?order=PO-xxxxx`
3. **Mock Data** - Falls back to sample orders if no data
