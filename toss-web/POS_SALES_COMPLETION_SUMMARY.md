## Technical Implementation Details

### Browser APIs Used
1. **WebHID API** - USB device communication
2. **Web Serial API** - Serial port communication
3. **MediaDevices API** - Camera access
4. **BarcodeDetector API** - Native barcode detection
5. **Web Audio API** - Beep sound generation

### Security Considerations
- User permission required for all hardware access
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported browsers
- Error handling for all hardware operations
- No sensitive data stored locally

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced barcode input (100ms)
- Efficient barcode detection (500ms interval)
- Canvas-based image processing
- Minimal DOM manipulation

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern Chrome/Edge (full support)
- Firefox (partial support - no WebHID)
- Safari (limited support)
- Fallback mechanisms for unsupported features
