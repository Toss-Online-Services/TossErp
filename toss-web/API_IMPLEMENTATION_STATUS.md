## 🎉 Key Achievements

### Data Consistency
- **Single source of truth**: All modules share same products, customers, suppliers
- **Real-time sync**: Changes propagate across all pages
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support throughout

### API Architecture
```
Component → useSalesAPI/useBuyingAPI → useInMemoryDB → Reactive Refs → UI Update
```

### Ready for Production
When connecting to real backend, **only update the composables**:

```typescript
// Current (In-Memory)
const getOrders = async () => {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))
  return db.salesOrders.value
}

// Production (Real Backend)
const getOrders = async () => {
  const { data } = await $fetch('/api/sales/orders')
  return data
}
```

**Zero component changes needed!** ✨
