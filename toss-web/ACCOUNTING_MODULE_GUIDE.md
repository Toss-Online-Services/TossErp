## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Trial Balance Not Balanced

**Causes & Fixes**:
1. **Unposted entries**
   - Filter journal entries by "Draft"
   - Post or delete drafts
2. **Partial entry**
   - Review recent entries
   - Check all have full line items

### Issue: Cannot Delete Account

---

### Issue: Cannot Edit Posted Entry

**Explanation**: Posted entries are locked for audit trail

**Fix**:
1. **If error in entry**: Reverse it, create new correct entry
2. **If need to modify**: Reverse old, post new

### Issue: VAT Calculation Seems Wrong

**Check**:

**Common Mistake**:
- Recording R 1,150 as revenue (should be R 1,000 + R 150 VAT)

**Correct Entry**:
```
Debit:  Cash           R 1,150
Credit: Revenue        R 1,000
Credit: VAT Payable    R   150
```

## üéì Accounting Basics (for Non-Accountants)

### The Accounting Equation

```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

**In English**:
"What you own = What you owe + What's truly yours"

### Debit vs. Credit (Simplified)

**Assets & Expenses** (Debit to increase):
- Debit = Add money/value
- Credit = Remove money/value

**Liabilities, Equity & Revenue** (Credit to increase):
- Debit = Remove money/value
- Credit = Add money/value

**Easy Rule**:
- Cash coming in = Debit Cash
- Cash going out = Credit Cash

### Double-Entry Bookkeeping

**Every transaction affects at least 2 accounts**

**Example**: Buy inventory for R 500 cash
```
Debit:  Inventory (Asset ‚Üë)    R 500
Credit: Cash (Asset ‚Üì)          R 500
```

**Why**: Keeps equation balanced!
