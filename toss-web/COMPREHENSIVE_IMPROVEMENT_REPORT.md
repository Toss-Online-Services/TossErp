## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. **Chart.js Component Registration Fix** ✅

**Problem:**  
- StatsCard, LineChart, and BarChart components were not rendering
- Vue warnings: "Failed to resolve component"
- Affected pages: Dashboard, Stock Management, and other analytics pages

**Solution Implemented:**  
Added manual imports to affected pages:

**Files Modified:**
1. `pages/dashboard/index.vue` - Added chart component imports
2. `pages/stock/index.vue` - Added chart component imports  
3. `nuxt.config.ts` - Added `~/components/charts` to component directories

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added to both dashboard/index.vue and stock/index.vue
import StatsCard from '~/components/charts/StatsCard.vue'
import LineChart from '~/components/charts/LineChart.vue'
import BarChart from '~/components/charts/BarChart.vue'
```

**Impact:**  
- ✅ Dashboard charts will now render correctly
- ✅ Stock dashboard charts will now render correctly
- ✅ Material Design stat cards with sparklines fully functional

---

### 2. **Vue Router Warning Fix** ✅

**Problem:**  
- Console warnings: `[Vue Router warn]: No match found for location with path "/group-buying"`
- Multiple components using incorrect `/group-buying` path instead of `/purchasing/group-buying`

**Solution Implemented:**  
Fixed all incorrect route paths across the application.

**Files Modified:**
1. `components/layout/MobileBottomNav.vue` - Fixed mobile navigation link
2. `components/township/GroupBuyingCard.vue` - Fixed router.push path
3. `components/AppNavigation.vue` - Fixed 2 instances (desktop + mobile)
4. `components/NotificationContainer.vue` - Fixed notification action

**Before:**
```typescript
router.push('/group-buying')
```

**After:**
```typescript
router.push('/purchasing/group-buying')
```

**Impact:**  
- ✅ No more Vue Router warnings in console
- ✅ All group buying links navigate correctly
- ✅ Mobile navigation works properly

The fixes I've implemented require a server restart to take effect. Here's what to do:

#### **Step 1: Stop the Current Dev Server**
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running.

#### **Step 2: Restart the Dev Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### **Step 3: Test the Fixes**

1. **Dashboard Charts Test:**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
   - ✅ **Expected:** You should see 4 gradient stat cards with sparklines
   - ✅ **Expected:** Daily Sales line chart should render
   - ✅ **Expected:** Sales by Category bar chart should render

2. **Stock Dashboard Charts Test:**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/stock`
   - ✅ **Expected:** Stat cards should render
   - ✅ **Expected:** Stock Movement chart should render
   - ✅ **Expected:** Top Selling Items chart should render

3. **No Router Warnings Test:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate between pages
   - ✅ **Expected:** No warnings about `/group-buying` path
   - ✅ **Expected:** Clean console with no route errors

## 🎯 REMAINING WORK (Optional)

### High Priority (If Needed)

2. ❌ **Mobile responsiveness testing**
3. ❌ **Linting/TypeScript error checks**

### Medium Priority (Future)
4. ❌ **Create utility functions composable** for formatDate, formatCurrency (DRY principle)
5. ❌ **Add proper TypeScript interfaces** for all data structures
6. ❌ **Implement loading states** for data fetching

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
7. ❌ **Add unit tests** for components
8. ❌ **Implement E2E tests** for critical flows
9. ❌ **Performance optimization** (lazy loading, code splitting)

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Restart dev server** - REQUIRED to see fixes
2. ✅ **Test dashboard and stock pages** - Verify charts render
