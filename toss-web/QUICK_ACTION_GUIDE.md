### **Step 3: Check Console** (Should be Clean!)

Press `F12` in your browser → Console tab

**Expected:**

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Charts Not Showing?**
**Solution:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)

### **Router Warnings in Console?**
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### **Styles Not Loading?**
**Solution:** Restart dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **TypeScript Errors in IDE?**
**Solution:** Ignore them - they're config issues, not runtime errors
