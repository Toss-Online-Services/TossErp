# ✅ Sidebar Menu Order Update - COMPLETE!

**Date:** January 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **UPDATED**

---

## 🎯 WHAT WAS CHANGED

### **Stock & Inventory Section - Menu Order**

**BEFORE:**
1. Stock Dashboard
2. Items
3. Stock Movements

**AFTER:**
1. Stock Dashboard
2. Stock Movements
3. **Items** (moved to last position)

---

## 📁 FILES MODIFIED

### **Desktop Sidebar:**
✅ **`components/layout/Sidebar.vue`**
- Reordered Stock & Inventory submenu
- Items now appears last in the list

---

## 📱 MOBILE NAVIGATION

**Note:** The mobile sidebar (`components/layout/MobileSidebar.vue`) only shows high-level section links (e.g., "Stock & Inventory") and does not display the submenu items. When users tap on "Stock & Inventory" on mobile, they go directly to the Stock Dashboard page.

**Mobile navigation structure:**
- Dashboard
- Stock & Inventory (links to /stock)
- Logistics (links to /logistics)
- Sales (links to /sales)
- Purchasing (links to /purchasing)
- Automation
- Onboarding
- Settings

The submenu items (Stock Dashboard, Stock Movements, Items) are only visible in the desktop sidebar navigation, which has now been updated.

## ✅ NEW MENU ORDER

### **Stock & Inventory Submenu:**

```
Stock & Inventory
  └── Stock Dashboard
  └── Stock Movements
  └── Items          ← Now last
```

This logical order puts:
1. **Dashboard first** - Overview
2. **Movements second** - Daily transactions (Stock IN/OUT/MOVED/FIXED)
3. **Items last** - Item management and setup

---

## 🎨 VISUAL UPDATE

The sidebar will now show:

```
📦 Stock & Inventory
  ├─ Stock Dashboard
  ├─ Stock Movements  
  └─ Items           ← Moved to bottom
```
