- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** - Already installed (styling)
- ✅ **Nuxt 4** - Your framework

### No Additional Packages Needed!
We built everything using what you already have. The Material Design look was achieved purely through:
- Smart use of Tailwind CSS utilities
- Custom Vue components
- Chart.js configuration
- CSS gradients and animations

## Color Themes

### Gradient Combinations Used:
1. **Blue** - `from-blue-500 to-blue-600` - Revenue, Total Items
2. **Green** - `from-green-500 to-emerald-600` - Sales growth, Categories

5. **Red** - `from-red-500 to-rose-600` - Alerts, Critical items

## Simple Language Used

As requested, the dashboard uses **simple, everyday words**:
- ❌ No "state management" or "API endpoints"
- ✅ Instead: "Track your stock", "View sales", "Reorder items"
- ❌ No technical jargon
- ✅ Clear action words: "Refresh", "View All", "Reorder"

## Mobile Responsive

All components work perfectly on:
- 📱 Mobile phones (320px+)
- 📱 Tablets (768px+)
- 💻 Laptops (1024px+)

## Dark Mode Support

Every component has full dark mode:
- Dark backgrounds (slate-800, slate-900)
- Adjusted text colors (white, slate-400)
- Border opacity adjustments
- Gradient adjustments for dark theme

## Performance

- ✅ Components are lazy-loaded
- ✅ Charts use canvas (hardware accelerated)
- ✅ No heavy animations
- ✅ Minimal bundle size impact
- ✅ Chart.js was already installed!

## Next Steps
