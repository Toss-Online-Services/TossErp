# TOSS ERP Inventory & Gap Analysis (2025-11-25)

## 1. Codebase Inventory

### Solutions & Projects
- No .sln solution files found
- 11 .csproj files (core layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, ServiceDefaults, Web, MigrationRunner, and test projects)

### Architecture Layers
- Clean Architecture layers present: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Presentation (Web)
- All layers reference each other as expected
- TargetFramework: net9.0

### Frontend
- Nuxt apps detected:
  - toss-web-app/nuxt.config.ts
  - toss-web/nuxt.config.ts
  - web/nuxt.config.ts
- No Flutter implementation; PWA-first approach confirmed
- No Mobile/ folder detected

### Containerization & CI/CD
- Dockerfile present in toss-web
- docker-compose.yml present in repo root and toss-web
- No Kubernetes manifests detected
- CI/CD workflows present in .github/workflows and backend/Toss/.github/workflows

### Shared Libraries
- backend/Toss/src/Infrastructure/Services
- backend/Toss/src/Web/Services

## 2. Gaps vs PRD
- No Flutter/mobile implementation; all mobile features must be delivered via PWA (Nuxt)
- No Kubernetes manifests; consider adding for cloud-native deployment
- No top-level .sln solution; consider adding for easier .NET management
- No explicit offline-first service worker config detected; ensure PWA features are implemented
- No Mobile/ folder; all mobile logic should be in Nuxt PWA

## 3. Prioritized Next Steps
1. Implement/verify full PWA features in Nuxt apps (offline, installable, push notifications, etc.)
2. Add/verify service worker and manifest.json for PWA compliance
3. Add Kubernetes manifests for production deployment (optional)
4. Add .sln solution file for .NET management (optional)
5. Continue modular expansion and implementation per PRD
