# TOSS Business Model for South African SMMEs

## Mission

TOSS's mission is to **empower small businesses in townships and rural areas** with a modern platform that helps them run efficiently, grow sustainably, and connect to a broader business ecosystem.

In practical terms, TOSS provides an easy-to-use **ERP-III platform** (a next-generation business management system) enhanced by an **AI Copilot** ("Service-as-Software") and a **collaborative network** connecting shop owners with suppliers, drivers, and other partners.

### Our Goal

Level the playing field so that a spaza shop or chisa nyama in a village can operate with the same advantages as large formal retailers, while addressing the unique challenges of informal enterprises.

---

## The Problem

Township and rural SMMEs (like spaza shops and chisa nyamas) face severe challenges that keep them in "survival mode."

### Key Challenges

#### 1. Poor Cash Flow & No Financial Records
- Many operate on cash-only sales, limiting growth and creating risk
- Cash trading means no clear transaction records
- Hard to manage cash flow or prove creditworthiness
- Without proper bookkeeping, owners can't analyze finances or get loans
- Limited cash flow makes it hard to maintain balanced stock levels

#### 2. No Formal Stock Records
- Inventory management is often ad-hoc
- Most owners don't use formal stock-keeping tools
- Stock buying is reactive ("as and when needed") rather than planned
- Frequent stockouts due to poor visibility

#### 3. Limited Access to Credit
- Banks and lenders rarely extend credit to micro-businesses
- Lack of financial histories or collateral
- No credit score or formal footprint due to cash trading
- Trapped in a cycle of low investment and growth

#### 4. High Supply Costs
- Small shops lack bulk buying power
- Pay higher prices for stock (can't access volume discounts)
- Buy from cash-and-carry wholesalers in small batches
- Operating in isolation means no negotiating power
- Goods end up more expensive, squeezing margins

#### 5. No Delivery & Logistical Barriers
- Formal suppliers often don't deliver to township areas
- Hard-to-reach locations: no formal addresses, informal roads
- Security concerns in high-crime areas deter suppliers
- Shop owners must close to travel for restocking, losing sales time
- Inefficient last-mile supply chain leads to stockouts and higher prices

#### 6. Skills Gaps
- Many entrepreneurs lack formal business training
- Limited skills in bookkeeping, inventory management, marketing
- Low technology adoption
- Few use POS systems or accounting software
- Learning on the job, but mistakes can be costly

#### 7. "One-Man Show" Trust Issues
- Owners work alone or only with close family
- Fear of theft or cash leakage prevents hiring
- Operating informally makes it hard to form partnerships
- Limits growth and causes burnout
- Can't delegate tasks without supervision tools

#### 8. Low Trust and Financial Inclusion
- Broad trust deficit with formal institutions
- Many prefer cash and distrust banks or digital finance
- Don't leverage services like insurance, banking, or fintech
- Kept financially excluded from growth opportunities

### The Impact

> "Cash-based trading keeps spaza shops in survival mode… without transparent systems to improve management, these businesses are shut out from growth opportunities."

These challenges result in stagnant businesses that just scrape by. Township SMMEs have the drive and market demand, but lack the tools, networks, and support to thrive.

## Who We Serve

### Target Users

TOSS is built for South Africa's underserved small business owners, especially in townships and rural areas:

#### Spaza Shops
- Informal convenience shops often run from a house, shack, or shipping container
- Sell daily necessities (bread, maize meal, airtime, etc.)
- Vital community lifelines
- Typically family-run with very slim margins
- Struggle with stock management and competition from larger retailers

#### Chisa Nyamas & Food Stalls
- Local barbecue stands and food vendors popular in townships
- Challenges in sourcing fresh ingredients at good prices
- Managing cash flow (customers buy on credit or pay cash)

#### Small Rural Retailers and Co-ops
- General dealers in villages
- Informal co-operative stores
- Micro-enterprises providing groceries or farm supplies
- Difficulty getting inventory regularly due to distance and costs

#### Other Township Services
- Hair salons, mechanics, tuck shops
- Home-based manufacturers (tailors, craft makers)
- Any SMME running informally can benefit

### Local Example: Mama Dlamini's Spaza Shop

Imagine **Mama Dlamini**, who runs a spaza shop in a rural Eastern Cape village:

- Sells flour, sugar, canned foods, snacks, and airtime
- Notes sales in a notebook (when she has time)
- Drives to town every week to restock
- Often runs out of popular items mid-week, losing sales
- No bank loan, borrows from family when cash is short
- Has no access to credit based on her sales history

**TOSS is built for Mama Dlamini** – to give her a simple system on her phone to:
- Track sales automatically
- Get smart suggestions on what to restock
- Combine orders with other shops for cheaper delivery
- Build financial history to access credit
